<p>In August last year, we conducted a survey for the Rust gamedev ecosystem.
After an unfortunate delay, we can finally present the results.
We received a whopping 403 responses!
This trove of valuable feedback will inform the WG's roadmap for 2020.</p>
<h1 id="hobbyist-or-developer">Hobbyist or developer?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#hobbyist-or-developer" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h1>
<p><img src="hobbyist-or-professional.png" alt="Respondents identifying as professional or hobbyist" />
Out of the 400 respondents, 3/4 identified as a <em>Hobbyist</em>.
It should also be noted that a significant portion
of the self-identified <em>Professionals</em> are more accurately described
as &quot;aspiring professional&quot; undertaking their first game development venture.
That still amounts to a large amount of commercial interest
in Rust game development all the same!</p>
<h1 id="are-you-using-rust-for-gamedev">Are you using Rust for gamedev?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#are-you-using-rust-for-gamedev" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h1>
<p><img src="using-rust.png" alt="Respondents using Rust in game development" />
Among the Professionals only 1/4 said they are currently using Rust in games.
That means the 200 respondents currently using Rust for gamedev are mostly hobbyists.
No surprise there, as most professionals can't bear the risk of being an early adopter.
Big shoutout to all the hobbyists who are pushing the status quo, and kudos
to the handful of studios that are using Rust in production
long before most of their industry peers have even caught the scent.</p>

</h2>
<p>Priorities for professionals and hobbyists are largely the same.
The biggest differences were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hobbyists call for ecosystem maturity 2x more than anything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hobbyists care much more about mobile/web support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professionals care much more about console support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Professionals care much more about C++ interop</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From playing in the space I know it's possible to make games using Rust.
However in the ecosystem my biggest negatives is the [lack of] case studies
and demonstrations of it working.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust is still a risky choice, compared to C++.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Still feels like a new community.
There is always risk associated with that - does the language
take a big swing in direction - does support drop off.
I'm encouraged by the support for low level (embedded / OS ) development,
which hopefully means the core feature set remains robust.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many unfinished, unmaintained crates. Lots of churn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of common needs are not yet available 'out of the box'.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="iteration-times-68">Iteration times (68)&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#iteration-times-68" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Compile time, no runtime reflection, updating deep dependency in the tree is hard.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Iteration time is I think too big, due to compilation time,
[lack of] hot-reloading tooling, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Iteration time (especially while prototyping).
This includes both compile time but also sorting out lifetimes when I know
I'll be rewriting something very soon anyway,
this &quot;frontloading&quot; the effort of having the borrow checker run at compile time
is useful for most tasks but when I want to try something quickly
it can be a draining experience,
in this regard GC'd languages have an advantage imo.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Prototyping seems not as easy in Rust due to &quot;fighting the compiler&quot;</p>

Very few real world examples to draw from.</p>

<p>The language has a higher upfront cognitive load than any other
mainstream language I know of, mostly due to the borrow checker.
It's very hard to hack through stuff and get away with it,
which makes it a particularly hard sell for game prototypes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that it is a less common language to use so as a company
I will have to have my staff learn Rust before they can start.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rust could be tricky to hire for, and hiring someone
who doesn't know Rust to work in Rust will come with a ramp-up period.</p>

<p>Tooling around IDE is limited compared to Visual Studio with C++ or C#.´</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definitely lack of proper IDE
(like out of the box Cargo integration and working debugger - yeah,
I tested Visual Studio Code and it's very slow, suggestions are not great,
fastest way to run, check and build is to use terminal - not IDE)
- I would say that something like QT Creator or Visual Studio would be great</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding debugging, the industry standard is (or that I'm aware of) Visual Studio,
for its very good IDE and tools, also, a lot of users are very used
to that kind of tools and looks like Rust is missing some of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>rust-analyzer is still very incomplete,
but it's the only thing that works for me</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Poor IDE and debugging support in IDE. Mainly visual studio.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can't debug it properly, hashmap (for example) is absolutely not debuggable.
Not sure how it works inside (instead of C++).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>debug mode way too slow, often need to set opt-level=1 or 2 for dev profile</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust is not officially supported on console by Sony or Microsoft.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust can't be seriously considered yet, because it does not have support
from the PS4 SDK.
Although there are other considerations
(studio culture, integration with existing systems, etc.),
official support from Sony is a requirement before Rust could be used
in a PS4 game.</p>

<p>Also, no professional game engine (UE4, Unity) integrates with Rust yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unknown compatibility</p>

<p>Lack of a straightforward path to make rust work easily
with C++ in both directions.
The only trustable way I see now is through manual C wrappers,

<blockquote>
<p>The language has a higher upfront cognitive load than any other mainstream language.
Which means that on an established, bigger project (maybe with a team behind)
the productivity is amazing compared to C++!
It's much easier to express strong &amp; safe interfaces
that make bugs just harder to introduce.
It really shines in network code that needs to be 100% safe and resist bad actors!
My current game server code has 0 unwraps/panics/expects
and so I just <em>know</em> it can't crash...
I wish I could have that feeling in C++.
C++ on the contrary makes it easy to whip up something which then has
a 20% crash rate and tanks perf and takes 2 weeks to hammer into shape,
and after those 2 weeks it looks like Rust code anyway.
Unfortunately, knowing the management culture in the gamedev industry,
Rust has an extremely hard road in front of it due to this.
In my experience gamedev is plagued by extreme short term (like, 1 month)
reasoning resulting in crunches and awful technical tradeoffs.
Rust made many choices that delay that fateful &quot;demo day with the execs&quot;
because it forces you to do things right.
But very few can express why this is valuable up the chain and be listened to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I love Rust!
• it's perfect for &quot;API-minded&quot; systems programmers
• as more production users come, things will get very good very quickly
• being cross-platform is easier than ever
• refactoring is very fun
• proc macros are cool as heck
• serde is insanely useful
• seriously there's a ton of awesome crates
• I know we'll get there together!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We are especially interested in data-driven games
for procedural generation and AI.
Rust seems a great fit for this computationally intensive work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since most game developers are tinkerers more than engineers or scientists,
the whole industry is plagued with bad code quality,
lack of architecture and bad code design.
Undefined behavior, nullptr exceptions, use after freed,
multithreading issues and so on are recurrent problems.
Rust biggest positive is really the fact that it addresses
all that without needing to change the people behind the games.
That's why I believe in it so much :).
Also worth noting that the module system and crates are really important
nowadays because monolithic codebases of millions of lines of code
is really a hell to work into.</p>

<p>Just for fun, we asked respondents to name libraries or projects
they were thankful for.
In the 6 months that have passed since this survey went out
there's been quite a few newcomers on the rise that would probably show
more prominently here if we asked again today.
Rest assured there will be more surveys.
