            <p>Welcome to the 14th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
<a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In September, Veloren hit 5000 commits to the main repo! A privilege escalation
bug was found in the game. It was quickly patched, and a PSA was sent out to
notify server owners of its presence. A Discord bot was created to help manage a
testing server. Airshipper, Veloren's launcher, saw the release of version
0.4.0. Lots of work is going on to improve the state of Veloren's server
infrastructure. A stress test was run with 15 players to see how smaller server
could handle running the game.</p>
<p>Improvements were made to the chunk compression which resulted in a ~7x memory
reduction in their storage. The settings menu has been overhauled, along with
many other elements of the UI. A stone golem boss was merged, adding a new boss
to dungeons. Work has been done on beam weapons and collisions, resulting in a
significantly improved healing sceptre.</p>

<em>A reprise from hunting at night</em></p>
<p>In October, Veloren will keep pushing towards more scalable infrastructure.
Tests are happening to move towards a Kubernetes cluster to manage more
infrastructure from code. Optimizations will keep coming in as we find places to
improve. 0.8 may release sometime this month, however, the exact date is yet to
be set.</p>

<li>OBJ models are now supported - useful for things like tree/vegetation geometry,
which can now use a stylized low-poly graphic without the added weight
of a bunch of cubes.</li>
<li>Palette-based rendering - the output system is now constrained
to a 256 color palette, mostly to play with stylized 3D rendering.</li>
<li>New format for data files that combines multiple RON objects in one place.</li>

<p>With the full power of Cargo build scripts and <a href="https://tera.netlify.app">Tera</a>, you can create an advanced
GLSL preprocessor which can generate code conditionally, in loops, and even
inherit code from other templates.</p>
<p><img src="opengl_preprocessor.png" alt="An OpenGL preprocessor for Rust" /></p>
<p>Writing plain GLSL code is uncomfortable, code is quite often is duplicated, libraries
aren't something natural for GLSL (means you can't out of the box do #include &quot;library.glsl&quot;).
The last point is especially problematic if some constants actually originate in
your game logic (like the number of player types). Updating these values manually
in your shader code is repetitive and prone to both error and simple forgetfulness.
It's really helpful to build some kind of preprocessor for your GLSL code,
which can include other files, so you can organize your code into manageable chunks.
With the power of <a href="https://tera.netlify.app">Tera</a>, it's now easy to accomplish.
Because Rust is also often used for web projects, which need a lot of templated
web-pages preprocessing, we can borrow such technology for our needs,
combine it with cargo build scripts and create a compile-time preprocessing tool.</p>

</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mooman219/fontdue">Fontdue</a> is a simple, no_std, pure Rust, TrueType &amp; OpenType
font rasterizer and layout tool.
It strives to make interacting with fonts as fast as possible,
and currently has the lowest end to end latency for a font rasterizer.</p>
<p>Fontdue depends on <a href="https://github.com/RazrFalcon/ttf-parser">ttf-parser</a> for parsing fonts,
which supports a wide range of TrueType and OpenType features.</p>
<p>A non-goal of this library is to be allocation free and have a fast,
&quot;zero cost&quot; initial load.
Fontdue does make allocations and depends on the alloc crate.
Fonts are fully parsed on creation and relevant information is stored
in a more convenient to access format.
Unlike other font libraries, the font structures have no lifetime dependencies
since it allocates its own space.</p>
<p>Project's roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li>v1.0: fontdue is designed to be a replacement for
rusttype, ab_glyph, parts of glyph_brush, and glyph_brush_layout.
This is a class of font libraries that don't tackle shaping.</li>
<li>v2.0: Shaping - the complex layout of text such as Arabic and Devanagari
- will be added.
There are two potential pure Rust libraries (allsorts or rustybuzz)
that are candidates for providing a shaping backend to Fontdue,
but are relatively immature right now.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra">Tetra</a> is a simple 2D game framework, inspired by XNA and Raylib. This month,
version <a href="https://twitter.com/17cupsofcoffee/status/1301210538299609088">0.5</a> was released, featuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cargo feature flags, allowing you to remove unused functionality and
shrink your build</li>
<li>Relative mouse events and infinite mouse movement (allowing for FPS-style
control schemes)</li>
<li>Extra methods for getting and setting the state of a playing sound</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://bevyengine.org">Bevy</a> is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust.
It is <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">free and open source</a> forever!</p>
<p>This month, thanks to 87 contributors, 174 pull requests, and their
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart">generous sponsors</a>, Bevy 0.2 was released. You can view the
<a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2">full Bevy 0.2 announcement here</a>. Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Async Task System: Bevy now has a brand new async-friendly task system,
which enables the creation of context-specific task pools. For example, you might
have separate pools for compute, IO, networking, etc. This also provides the
flexibility to load balance work appropriately according to work type and/or priority.
This new task system completely replaces Rayon and the cpu usage wins were huge!</li>
<li>Initial Web Platform Support: (A subset of) Bevy now runs on the web using
WebAssembly/WASM! Specifically, Bevy apps can run Bevy ECS schedules, react to
input events, create an empty canvas (using winit), and a few other things. This
is a huge first step, but it is important to call out that there are still a
number of missing pieces, such as 2D/3D rendering, multi-threading, and sound.</li>
<li>Parallel Queries: Systems that use queries already run in parallel,
but before this change the queries themselves could not be iterated in parallel.
Bevy 0.2 adds the ability to easily iterate queries in parallel, which builds on
top of the new Async Task System.</li>
<li>Transform System Rewrite: Bevy's old transform system used separate
<code>Translation</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, and <code>Scale</code> components as the &quot;source of truth&quot;,
which were then synced to a <code>LocalTransform</code> component after each update. There
are Good Reasons™ to use this approach, but it created a &quot;lag&quot; between the
calculated LocalTransform and the source components and dataflow between components
is hard to reason about. This problem was resolved by making a newer, simpler
transform system that uses a consolidated <code>Transform</code> type.</li>
<li>Joystick/Gamepad Input: The Bevy Input plugin now has cross-platform support
for most controllers thanks to the gilrs library!</li>
<li>Bevy ECS Performance Improvements: generational entity IDs,
read-only queries, lock-free world APIs, direct component lookup.</li>
</ul>
