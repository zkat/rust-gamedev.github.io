<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>Veloren's 3rd birthday was at the end of May, on the 25th! During the month,
lots of systems were overhauled. Music changes were made to only play certain
tracks in certain areas. Econsim was optimized, and many bugs were fixed. The
minimap was overhauled, with many quality-of-life and visual improvements.
Terrain compression speed was worked on, with many trials of different
compression techniques.</p>
<p>The large physics overhaul was merged, and lots of patches are being added to
issues that popped up from it. You can see a small flight in action
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Veloren/comments/nc4tvo/i_cant_believe_how_beautiful_this_game_is/">here</a>. Dungeons have been balanced, and many weapons have also
seen changes. In June, 0.10 will be released.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/a-b-street/abstreet">A/B Street</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlinoDustin">@dabreegster</a> is a traffic simulation game exploring how small
changes to roads affect cyclists, transit users, pedestrians, and drivers, with
support for any city with OpenStreetMap coverage. The project aims to engage
more citizens with transportation planning, letting people advocate for real
changes they want to see.</p>
<p>In May, travel time stopped being the only &quot;score&quot; for how well road changes
work. Risk exposure of cyclists crossing dangerous intersections or travelling
in front of high-speed traffic is now measured, with lots of data visualization
work by Michael. Trevor also revived the 15-minute isochrone tool, finding
areas of a city without easy access to education, hospitals, or other
facilities. We also moved the map import process, with over 100 supported maps,
to the cloud from a single poor laptop. OpenStreetMap importing now handles
multiple turn lanes, U-turns, and stop signs much better.</p>

<p><a href="https://katharostech.com/post/bounty-bros-update-3-sound-and-ui">Bounty Bros.</a> is a prototype game, similar to the old Legend of
Zelda® games, developed by <a href="https://katharostech.com">Katharos Technology</a> as a testing
ground for a future commercial game.</p>
<p>The last two months of development was primarily focused on sound and user
interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Music will play in different areas of the map and fade in when walking into
an area with different music.</li>
<li>In-game UI is now functional including a new start menu and a simple settings
menu to toggle the CRT filter and pixel aspect ratio.</li>
<li>The web player now has a simple loading icon instead of a solid black screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The web version was re-built and published under a new link so you can <a href="https://katharostech.github.io/skipngo_pre-releases/refs/tags/pre-release-1/?asset_url=https://katharostech.github.io/bounty-bros_pre-releases/1">try it

<p>Harvest Hero is currently on hold for now. After
<a href="https://twitter.com/GemdropGames">Gemdrop Games</a> was formed, it was decided
that <a href="https://github.com/Bombfuse/emerald">Emerald</a> needed to be tested to ensure it can withstand cross
publishing.
This means creating a smaller game in the
engine in order to figure out the publishing process for
Steam, Itch, Nintendo Switch, and guarantee its viability.</p>
<p>This resulted in the birth of <a href="https://gemdrop-games.itch.io/harvest-hero-origins">Harvest Hero Origins</a>, a small wave

<p><a href="https://github.com/zer0x64/nestadia">Nestadia</a> by @zer0x64, @junior-n30 and @CBenoit is a
server-based NES emulator.</p>
<p>Nestadia was written as a reverse engineering and memory exploitation challenge
for NorthSec CTF 2021, a cybersecurity competition. Contestants were required to
reverse-engineer the emulator and ultimately write a Tool Assisted Speedrun to
run arbitrary code inside a provided ROM.</p>
<p>After the competition, the code was open-sourced and cleaned up to remove
references to the competition. The developers intend on fixing more bugs and
adding more features in the near future.</p>
<p>Some interesting features of this emulator are its server-based nature, and the
no_std core which means that the emulator can be built and ran pretty much
anywhere without much work.</p>
<p>Incoming improvements include online multiplayer, sound, a WASM port, porting to
a libretro core, and using wgpu instead of sdl for the native GUI and debugger.</p>

<p>After some GLSL issues trying to update the <a href="https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu">&quot;Learn WGPU&quot;</a> tutorial
to version WGPU 0.8, <a href="https://patreon.com/sotrh">@sotrh</a> decided to migrate to WGSL.
This update was a lot of work, but relatively painless.
As a result, <code>shaderc</code> is no longer a dependency.</p>

<p>Additionally, some rendering features were improved and added: mesh rendering
now uses an instance-rate vertex buffer instead of per-object uniforms,
improving performance. Rendering features now support wireframe and untextured
rendering modes. An egui render feature was added, and the demo now uses egui

<p><img src="bevy_asset_loader.png" alt="Configuring two asset collections" /></p>
<p><code>bevy_asset_loader</code> by <a href="https://twitter.com/nikl_me">@nikl_me</a> is a plugin for <a href="https://bevyengine.org">Bevy</a> apps aiming to
improve a common pattern for asset-loading. The boilerplate required to load
assets during a &quot;loading state&quot; is reduced to a minimum. At the same time, the
plugin brings together the internal names of assets and their filepath, making
it easier to add new assets and to keep an overview over already existing ones.</p>
<p>The library introduces the <code>AssetCollection</code> trait that can be derived. Any
number of asset collections can be loaded by a single <code>AssetLoader</code> during a
configured app state. When all assets are loaded, the collections will be
inserted into Bevy's ECS as resources. Afterwards, the <code>AssetLoader</code> will
switch into a second configurable app state. At this point, your app can use
the asset collections that now contain loaded asset handles.</p>
<p>Currently, a single file always corresponds to one asset, and more complex
assets like e.g. <code>TextureAtlas</code> are not yet supported. There are plans to
extend the <code>asset</code> attribute to allow loading more complex assets. Stay tuned!</p>

<p><code>tobj</code> by <a href="https://github.com/Twinklebear/">@Twinklebear</a> and <a href="https://github.com/virtualritz">@virtualritz</a> is a simple and lightweight
option for loading OBJ files. <code>tobj</code> was originally written inspired by
<a href="https://github.com/syoyo">@syoyo</a>'s tinyobjloader, to provide a similar lightweight and easy to integrate
API for loading OBJ files in Rust.</p>
<p>While initially targeted at realtime rendering applications, <code>tobj</code> has gained
more advanced importer functionality required for offline rendering,
simulation, and modeling applications, through recent work by <a href="https://github.com/virtualritz">@virtualritz</a>.
These features provide support for merging vertices to avoid discontinuities
in simulation packages and reordering vertices to allow omitting the
index buffer. These features have been added while preserving the original
lightweight API design goal of <code>tobj</code>, making it a useful crate for a range of
applications loading with OBJ files.</p>

<p>One could e.g. use this for a compact definition of a game's levels and mesh
them adaptively, on the fly, during loading. With a density suitable for the
