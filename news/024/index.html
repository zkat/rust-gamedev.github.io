<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In July, work focused on larger tasks that tend to come up between versions.
Optimizations were made for networking with compression, and message queue
improvements (<a href="https://veloren.net/devblog-127">devblog #127</a>). Modular weapons are in the works, which
will allow for much more dynamic ways to choose what you fight with. The project
also hit 300k lines of code.</p>
<p>Many contributors are working on the art and asset front, with lots of new SFX,
models, and UI elements making their way into the game. Caves are also getting a
lot of love, and a bloom feature is being integrated. Some members broke down
what they plan to have done by the 0.11 release at the beginning of September,
and you can read about that in <a href="https://veloren.net/devblog-130">devblog #130</a>.</p>

<em>Extracting the game assets</em></p>
<p>Shroom Kingdom (<a href="https://github.com/Shroom-Kingdom">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/SPZsgSe">Discord</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shrm_kingdom">Twitter</a>)
is an upcoming play-to-earn video game built with web technologies
running on the <a href="https://near.org">NEAR Blockchain</a>.
In a recent <a href="https://net64-mod.github.io/blog/shroom-kingdom/">blog post</a> you can read the motivation behind this.</p>
<p>You can play with your favorite plumber brothers.
Build your own levels or play levels from others.
Every level built on Shroom Kingdom is stored
on the blockchain as an NFT.</p>
<p>By playing the game you can either actively earn SHRM tokens via participating
in game activities or earn them passively, if other people play or like your levels.
The SHRM token will be used to acquire in-game purchases such as unlocking new
building blocks or increasing level upload limits.</p>
<p>You can either extract existing assets from Super Mario Maker 2 or use
compatible game mod files from e.g. <a href="https://gamebanana.com/">Gamebanana</a>.
The asset extractor is already working, but support for more file types
needs to be added.</p>
<p>The game will likely be built with <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a>
and <a href="https://rapier.rs/">Rapier</a> compiled to WebAssembly.
Next steps include developing a Proof of Concept.</p>

<em>Match ingredients to brew wicked potions</em></p>
<p><a href="https://niklme.itch.io/wicked-potions">Wicked Potions</a> is a match-three game developed by
<a href="https://twitter.com/nikl_me">@nikl_me</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/profile/jennifervphan">jennifervphan</a> for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/bored-pixels-jam-8">Bored Pixels Jam 8</a>.
They wrote the game using the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy game engine</a> and created all of the
textures and audio.</p>
<p>The main focus of the game during the one-week jam period were the assets.
After the voting period, the developers plan to extend the game mechanics
and story a bit more.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/NiklasEi/wicked_potions">The code for the game is available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<em>The godot_egui backend powering a new inventory UI for The Process</em></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess">The Process</a> by @setzer22 is an upcoming game about factory building,
process management, and carrot production,
built with Rust using the Godot game engine!</p>
<p>Continuing with last month's migration of old GDScript code to ECS in Rust, this
month's main focus has been on porting the GUI code. This has resulted in
the birth of a Godot integration for <a href="https://docs.rs/egui/">egui</a> that now
powers the game's interface.</p>
<p>This month has seen the following changes and improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finished migration of character controller code to ECS style. Now with <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1413081233396011012">300%
more jumps!</a></li>
<li>Implemented <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1413943539160031246">better ambient
lighting</a> and
enable using different skies for radiance and display. This required a <a href="https://github.com/setzer22/godot/tree/feature/cosmetic_sky">forked

<li>Implement a <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1417774452012724226">new inventory and

interface using egui.</li>
<li>Integrated the <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1420277428199559174">puffin

<p><code>ggez</code> 0.6 has been released!  <code>ggez</code> is a lightweight cross-platform
game framework for making 2D games with minimum friction, with an API
inspired by Love2D.</p>
<p>This release includes many additions, improvements, and bug fixes,
including a <code>MeshBatch</code> type for drawing many instances of the same
geometry, improvements to canvas drawing, updated <code>winit</code> dependencies
that function more smoothly on Linux under Wayland, better error
handling, and more.  The whole changelog is available
<a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/0.6.0/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>More importantly, <code>ggez</code> is now maintained by a group of volunteers,
with the original maintainer stepping down from active development after
over four years.  The new maintainers are mostly responsible for the 0.6
release, and will hopefully be bringing good ideas and tech to the
library for years to come.  For details, see <a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez/issues/875">this github

<p><a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad">Macroquad</a> is a cross-platform game framework, inspired heavily by Raylib.</p>
<p>This month, a <a href="https://macroquad.rs/tutorials/android/">new tutorial</a> was published on the
Macroquad website, showing how a game written with the framework can be
ported to Android. It details all of the steps, from building to packaging
for a release on Google Play.</p>
<p>In other news, Macroquad used to depend on rodio+cpal for audio on
native platforms and a custom WebAudio implementation for web, with a custom
abstraction on top of both. This month, Macroquad's audio system was
reimplemented on top of raw OS APIs - ALSA, OpenSLES, CoreAudio and WASAPI.
This functionality has now been extracted into a crate: <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/quad-snd">quad-snd</a>.</p>

by Herbert Wolverson is now in print, as a full color paperback and ebook.
The book teaches Rust through game development examples, and is targeted at
readers who have some experience with writing code in other languages. It
teaches beginner to intermediate-level Rust. Hands-on Rust also teaches
high-level game development concepts, notably Entity-Component System (ECS)
theory.</p>
<p>After walking you through installing Rust, a few simple examples teach the
language basics. Then you put these together to make &quot;Flappy Dragon&quot; - a
simple Flappy Bird clone. The book then changes gear and begins to build a
dungeon crawler (roguelike) with tile graphics.</p>
<p>Outside of the USA, Hands-on Rust is available through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1680508164">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>Herbert also published the first <a href="https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/flappy-dragon-rust-647e91a34dd4">&quot;Hands-on Rust bonus content&quot;</a>.
The bonus content extends Flappy Dragon to include smooth movement and
animated sprites.</p>

<p>Dimitry Stepanov (aka @mrDIMAS) published a
<a href="https://rg3d.rs/tutorials/2021/07/09/rpg-tutorial1.html">tutorial series</a> about
making an RPG in Rust using the rg3d game engine. In part one of the series,
he builds a character controller from scratch. While that may not sound very exciting,
it's still a great way to learn the basics of rg3d and Rust gamedev in general!</p>

<p>Graphite (<a href="https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://discord.graphite.design">Discord</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/GraphiteEditor">Twitter</a>) is an in-development vector and
raster graphics editor built on a non-destructive node-based workflow.</p>
<p>In the past month, the editor has gained numerous vector editing features,
including moving layers with the keyboard or mouse, filling and copying colors,
flipping and aligning selected layers, and setting blend modes and layer
opacity.</p>
<p>Scrollbars, rulers, and thumbnails are now functional. Full screen support has
been added, along with a hotkey to center the artwork. An options bar with
tool-specific settings and actions has been implemented, currently allowing
the number of sides of a polygon to be selected. The order of layers can now be
changed using hotkeys.</p>
<p><a href="https://editor.graphite.design">Try it right now in your browser.</a> Graphite is making
rapid progress towards becoming a non-destructive, procedural graphics editor
suitable of replacing traditional 2D DCC applications. The release of Graphite
0.1 is anticipated in the coming month; come

<p><a href="https://github.com/t-mw/throne">Throne</a> is a new scripting language for game prototyping and story logic. The
language is rule-based, which allows certain types of logic to be expressed more
concisely than using an object-based language, while remaining fast to execute
and easy to embed in an existing engine. Throne can be experimented with in the
web <a href="https://t-mw.github.io/throne-playground/">playground</a>.</p>

<p><img src="godot_egui.gif" alt="godot_egui" /></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.rs/godot_egui/">godot_egui</a> is an integration of the <a href="https://github.com/emilk/egui">egui</a>
crate for the Godot engine using Rust, enabling highly dynamic and performant
user interfaces in an immediate-mode style in Godot.</p>
<p>Godot has a great GUI system, so why use <code>godot_egui</code> instead? A more in-depth
rationale can be found in the crate's README, but the main reason is to provide
a GUI system for godot-rust games that is closer to Rust's data driven
philosophy.</p>
<p>Unlike other egui integrations, <code>godot_egui</code> has the special feature of being
embedded as a custom Godot scene tree node. This effectively allows combining
Godot's retained mode UI and container-based placement with the simplicity of
immediate-mode style GUI code of <code>egui</code>, getting the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/setzer22/godot-egui">github repository</a> has an example
project and usage instructions to get you started with immediate-mode GUI
programming with Godot and Rust!</p>

<p>Following the <a href="https://gamedev.rs/news/023/#wgpu-family-re-union">Family Reunion</a> initiative, <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a> team has been busy rebuilding
the graphics infrastructure. The new D3D12 backend has been merged, which
concludes the trip of moving (or rewriting?) all of the implementation into
Rust. In addition to a &quot;lean and mean&quot; implementation of the host API side,
which turned out to match the WebGPU API very well, the new backend works with
<a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/naga">naga</a> exclusively for generation of HLSL shaders.
This is in contrast with gfx-backend-dx12, which only supported SPIRV-Cross.</p>
<p>The team also wrote the blog post <a href="https://gfx-rs.github.io/2021/07/16/release-0.9-future.html">Release of v0.9 and the Future of wgpu</a>.
One of the interesting bits is <code>gfx</code> repository switching to
maintenance mode.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, Francesco Cattoglio described their adventure
with rewriting <a href="https://gfx-rs.github.io/stories/franzplot.html">Franzplot</a> on a new blog hosted by the wgpu team. This blog will
accumulate stories of wgpu users and their interesting projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/katharostech/bevy_retro">Bevy Retrograde</a> (formerly Bevy Retro) is a <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> plugin
designed for making pixel-perfect games as easily as possible.</p>
<p>This project was released under the <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/katharos-license">Katharos License</a>. This
license has moral and ethical implications that you may or may not agree with,
so please read it before making use of this project.</p>
<p>In the last two months, Bevy Retrograde has gotten a major update and is also on
crates.io for the first time!</p>
<ul>
<li>The transform system was migrated to use Bevy's own transform system.</li>
<li>The pixel-perfect alignment restriction can now be optionally disabled on a
per-sprite basis. This makes it possible to do smooth character and projectile
movement if desired.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/jcornaz/heron">Heron</a> physics engine ( which is powered by Rapier ) was integrated, with
a custom extension for automatically creating collision shapes from sprite
outlines.</li>
<li>It was decided to start work on migrating Bevy Retrograde to use Bevy's own
rendering abstraction, making it compatible with the larger Bevy rendering
ecosystem. This will hopefully be finished in the next release.</li>
</ul>
