<p>The first iteration of the Rust Gamedev Meetup happened in January. It was an
opportunity for developers to show of what Rust projects they've been working on
in the game ecosystem. Developers showed off physics engines, custom build
tools, renderers, and more. You can watch the recording of the meetup <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L3w3UiEzAk">here on
Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>The next meetup will take place 13th of February
at 16:00 GMT on the <a href="https://discord.gg/yNtPTb2">Rust Gamedev Discord server</a>, and can
also be <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rustgamedev">streamed on Twitch</a>.</p>

<em>Over the mountains in Slovakia</em></p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMmaJuk-D7iaObZyhyvc83tNwpx3ghzkY">SeniorSKY</a>
is a flight simulator which uses Vulkan API, developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/pmathia0">@pmathia0</a>.
As an aerospace engineering student, Peter has always been interested how
a flight simulator works under the hood.
The development of SeniorSKY started as a hobby project during university
studies.</p>
<p>SeniorSKY uses real-world elevation data with 1 arc
second precision and can render the whole globe in real dimensions.
During the flight, the terrain tiles are loaded dynamically based
on real GPS coordinates of airplane, with a decreasing level of detail
further from the camera. This is achieved using a combination
of a terrain-quad-tree and GPU tessellation.</p>
<p>SeniorSKY also implements basic rendering of sky, atmosphere and fog.</p>
<p>To be able to simulate a flight, the application temporarily integrates 3rd party
flight dynamics engine called JSBSim. Meanwhile, development of own, custom
flight dynamics is already in progress.</p>

<a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a>.</p>
<p>Colorless puzzle pieces try to reach your base. Your towers have to shoot at
the pieces to uncover their color. After defeating a piece, it will try to run
away and you should catch it to upgrade your towers or build new ones.</p>

<li>All random numbers are from seeded generators so it makes bugs easier
to reproduce.</li>
<li>A big chunk of a replay system is finished.
This should help a lot with reproducing issues. Plus, it's really fun to watch.</li>
<li>Bug fixes and performance improvements, mostly related to
