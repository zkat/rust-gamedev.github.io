<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In September, Veloren hosted its largest release party ever! At peak, 181 players
were playing on the server together. You can read about all the changes to 0.11
in <a href="https://veloren.net/release-0-11/">the release blog</a>, and be sure to watch the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1oOjvaWJlw">release trailer</a>! During the release party, several devs
spoke about the changes, which you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Xz-vbE27Q">here</a>. This
release party was the first one to handle the high player load with no issues,
and give hope for much larger servers in the future.</p>
<p>Shaderc was replaced with Naga early on in the month. This was the result of
over a year of work. Hitboxes are in the process of being overhauled to handle
non-cylindrical targets better. Improvements were made to how the cursor selects
objects in game. As always, lots of experimental work is being done to the
economic system. Cultist raiders were added, which means that raiding parties
will now attack nearby settlements. This is a great example of how the realtime
simulation is starting to become more visible to players.</p>

<p>Gemdrop Games recently took Harvest Hero Origins to <a href="https://twitter.com/GemdropGames/status/1433819047481659394">PAX West 2021</a>
and had a very positive response from most of the players!
Being able to watch people play the game was extremely valuable,
the developers were able to see pain points in UI/UX design
and can now fix them without worry.
They were also able to see what players find fun about controlling each hero,
which helps with the next hero planning in the full release of the game.</p>
<p>Harvest Hero Origins is still planned to release by the end of 2021,
please wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651500/Harvest_Hero_Origins">Steam</a>!</p>

<p>Molecoole is a topdown action roguelite where you connect with different atoms
to create the strongest Molecoole to defeat the baddies! Molecoole was created
by two brothers: <a href="https://twitter.com/kiss_mrton">Márton</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/FrenetiqDan">Dániel</a>.</p>
<p>In Molecoole the strongest focus is about making different combos by connecting
atoms. The original version was made in Unity for a game jam, but they decided
to make an actual game out of it using the Bevy engine. It currently includes
their own implementation for 2D animation, collision detection, and particles.
In September, one of the main development areas was making the game nicer to
play, so they introduced the <a href="https://github.com/michaelfairley/ezing">ezing</a> crate and also implemented slowing the
<a href="https://twitter.com/kiss_mrton/status/1434189320865341444">game time</a>. They are using the <a href="https://ldtk.io">LDtk</a> editor to make the level sections for the

<p>In September, the project previously codenamed &quot;garden&quot; has been renamed to
&quot;idu&quot;! In Idu, every plant is continuously formed by the simulation. There are
unique responses from a plant's surroundings and your care. Simulated leaves and
shoots grow into plants with a mind of their own. Here is the changelog of Demo Version
4:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed freezing when help menu was displayed</li>
<li>Added support for all older Ubuntu versions from 16.04</li>
<li>Fixed crashing when roots extended over the world border</li>
<li>Pressing ESC in menus acts as a back button</li>
<li>Fixed the issue where pruning didn't work on the first day after loading the game</li>
<li>Fixed the game choosing integrated GPU even when a discrete one was available</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ggez/good-web-game">good-web-game</a> has been released on crates.io, together with <a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez">ggez</a> 0.6.1!
ggez is a lightweight cross-platform game framework for making 2D games
with minimum friction, with an API inspired by Love2D. good-web-game is a
subset of ggez, which is based upon <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/miniquad">miniquad</a> and can therefore run natively
on the web, mobile and of course desktop as well.</p>
<p>good-web-game was originally created to run <a href="https://ozkriff.itch.io/zemeroth">Zemeroth</a> on the web. However,
as Zemeroth switched from using ggez to <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/">macroquad</a> the project was
discontinued, until recently. In search of <a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez/issues/962">a new graphics backend for ggez</a>
the ggez team now picked up development again and released a massive update,
updating good-web-game for compatability to ggez 0.6, expanding its
functionality.</p>
<p>With only <a href="https://github.com/PSteinhaus/PSteinhaus.github.io/blob/main/ggez/web-examples/README.md#ggez-animation-example">a single change in boilerplate code</a> many ggez 0.6 games can now be
directly ported to good-web-game. Yet, it's no drop in replacement for ggez
as <a href="https://github.com/ggez/good-web-game#differences">several key differences remain</a>.</p>

<p>Besides smaller bugfixes, the library itself added support for <code>serde</code>

<em>Grouping bodies into disjoint &quot;islands&quot;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/m0lentum/starframe/">Starframe</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/molentum_">@molentum</a> is a work-in-progress game engine for physics-y
sidescrolling 2D games.</p>
<p>This month, a lot of work was done on optimizing the physics engine.
Most importantly, <a href="https://twitter.com/molentum_/status/1432441648890449920">spatial partitioning was added</a> to speed up
collision detection. Also notably, <a href="https://twitter.com/molentum_/status/1438877808412008450">a graph algorithm was
implemented</a> to divide the world into disjoint islands,
enabling some parallelism and skipping of computations.</p>
<p>Starframe's physics is now very close to game-ready, and it no longer makes
sense to work on the engine without a concrete project to use it.
Thus, work has begun on a platformer based around connecting things with ropes.
More details to be shown soonish!</p>

<em>Two clients connected to the same server</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/arcana">Arcana</a> is ECS based game engine focused on simplicity and performance.</p>
<p>It recently got huge progress towards multiplayer support.
Traditional client-server systems were added and used in the <a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/arcana/tree/master/examples/tanks">&quot;Tanks&quot; example</a>.</p>
<p>Clients send only command queue to the server and server sends game world updates
to the clients. Engine supports multiple players per client.
For example, players may be added for each active input device.</p>
<p>To allow wide variety of genres player is not attached to one specific entity
and may control many.
In RTS player may control all their units and will send commands for each one.</p>
<p>Gameplay system that consumes commands doesn't even need to be aware of netcode.
Either way, it just drains command queue of an entity and utilizes them.
That system must not be run on clients at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/arcana">Arcana</a> is very early work-in-progress and may not always work
out-of-the-box atm, but stability improvements are expected next month.</p>

<em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/paz35s/capstone">Capstone</a> - a WIP game that uses Rust RPG Toolkit</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/olefasting/rust_rpg_toolkit">Rust RPG Toolkit</a> by <a href="https://github.com/olefasting">@olefasting</a> is an engine for creating
highly customizable and user modable action 2D action RPG's using Rust amd JSON.</p>
<p>The project started out as a part of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/paz35s/capstone">Capstone</a> game but was separated
as it grew in scope.
It uses JSON files for most of its game data and resources specification
so that games can be created with very little interaction with the Rust code.
This has the benefit of making the end product very easy to modify,
both for non-developers involved in the development process, and by end users.
Modification can be done either by modifying a game's data files directly,
or by creating user modules, which are supported out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>Note that this is in early and very heavy development: the API is subject to
constant change, as it has newly transitioned from being a game project
to a library.</p>
