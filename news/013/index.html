<blockquote>
<p>Over the lockdown period I have been working on a new podcast
for Rust game developers. I have been interviewing indie teams
and library creators, discussing custom engines, procedural generation,
open source and the business of games development.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rustgamedev.com/episodes/interview-with-team-veloren">The first episode</a> is an interview
with the team behind Veloren, an open-source multiplayer
voxel RPG written in Rust.</p>
<p>Find out about the game's origin, its engine development,
pros and cons of a big open-source project, CI and build pipeline,
importance of artists, procedural generation,
community building, managing players' expectations,
and upcoming developments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rustgamedev.com/episodes/interview-with-herbert-wolverson-bracket-lib">The second episode</a> is an interview with Herbert Wolverson,
creator of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bracket-lib">bracket-lib</a> (pka RLTK), <a href="http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com">Rust Roguelike Tutorial</a>,
and <a href="https://thebracket.itch.io/nox-futura">Nox Futura</a>.</p>
<p>A very wide-ranging interview covering many interesting topics:
where the bracket-lib came from and what the creator is doing now,
as well as practical questions and issues discovered
in the course of creating their game, [Nox Futura].
Lots of interesting talk about a new Rust games development book
Herbert is writing, C++ vs Rust, learning Rust, code architecture and
ECS's in roguelikes, emergent behavior, and hilarious bugs in Dwarf Fortress.</p>

<em>Landscape with new LoD and lighting</em></p>
<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In August, Veloren 0.7 was released! Airshipper, Veloren's launcher, also got
updated to 0.4.0. Veloren was featured in the inaugural episode of the <a href="https://rustgamedev.com/episodes/interview-with-team-veloren">Rust
Game Dev Podcast</a>. Although the 0.7 release party saw the
largest number of concurrent players at 57, it ran into some significant issues
which you can read about below.</p>
<p>The largest merge in Veloren so far also happened in August. It included
monumental changes to lighting and added level of detail functionality to see
far-off mountains. Lots of work has been done on the animation, combat, SFX, and
UX front. Animations for movement and combat were added and improved. Work
continued on particle systems, which have been added to Veloren in places like
campfires, fireworks, and weapons.</p>

<p>In September, work on 0.8 will continue. Some large systems being worked on
include networking, improved persistence stability, and player experience. Game
design is working on improving the connection between the experience a new
player has, and the current game design. The in-progress 0.8 version will likely
be completed more quickly than 0.7, as to not include too many changes.</p>

into spikes.</p>

The new demo includes a level that wasn't part of the Steam Game Festival,
showing off how circuit puzzles will work in the game. Since Play NYC
couldn't be in person this year, the devs temporarily themed this level to look
like last year's Play NYC venue, included placing virtual booths for other games
throughout the level.</p>

<p><a href="https://neocogi.com">Jude3D</a> is a web based 3D sculpting application.
It's a WebAssembly application, written in C/C++ and compiled using Emscripten
but after much thinking, the authors decided to move the development to Rust!</p>
<p>Many problems arise when moving existing C/C++/WebAssembly code to Rust.
The two most important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new code should still interop with the already existing code.</li>
<li>Payload size matters on the web: your WASM app should be as small as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>These led the authors to drop using Rust's std in favor to their own libs (<code>!#[no_std]</code>),
at least until the std library crates are split up accordingly and stabilized,
for example, the <code>alloc</code> crate.</p>
<p>The good news is that they are
<a href="https://github.com/NeoCogi">releasing most of the libraries as they make them as open source</a>!

<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hexasphere">hexasphere</a> library provides a customizable interface for subdividing 3D
triangle meshes. Custom and stateful interpolation functions can be implemented
as well as per-vertex attributes.</p>
<p>All that's required to define a base shape are the initial vertices, triangles
based on the indices of the vertices in the initial vertices, and numbered
edges. As long as the winding of the triangles remains consistent throughout
the base mesh, all of the resulting triangles will retain that winding.</p>
<p>This library also provides a few interesting base shapes (which can be used alone
if the shape is not subdivided):
Icosahedron, Tetrahedron, Cube, Square Plane, Triangle Plane
(all of which are pictured above).</p>

tweak at runtime any number literal directly from your code.
It works by parsing the file when a change occurs
(inspired by <a href="http://blog.tuxedolabs.com/2018/03/13/hot-reloading-hardcoded-parameters.html">this blogpost</a> from Tuxedo labs).
Usage example:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#b48ead;">use </span><span>inline_tweak::tweak;
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">loop </span><span>{
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#65737e;">// Try changing the value while the application is running
</span><span>    println!(&quot;</span><span style="color:#d08770;">{}</span><span>&quot;, tweak!(</span><span style="color:#d08770;">3.14</span><span>));
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>A <code>watch!()</code> macro that sleeps until the file is modified is also provided.</p>
<p>The library is minimal, only requiring the <code>lazy_static</code> dependency
to hold modified values.
In release mode, the tweaking code is disabled and compiled away.</p>

of writing) and it also supports all the new shader stages (both ray tracing
and mesh/task shaders) as well as the existing ones.</p>
<p>Traverse Research wanted to reduce their reliance on C and C++ unsafe

<li><a href="https://medium.com/@bonsairobo/smooth-voxel-mapping-a-technical-deep-dive-on-real-time-surface-nets-and-texturing-ef06d0f8ca14">&quot;Smooth Voxel Mapping: a Technical Deep Dive on Real-time Surface Nets and Texturing&quot;</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Upcoming on the roadmap are procedural generation algorithms for generating
maps, new kinds of voxels, and graphical improvements. Currently, the library
and editor depend on the Amethyst engine version 0.15, but there is a desire to
make the library engine-agnostic. Contributions are welcome!</p>

<p><a href="https://bevyengine.org">Bevy</a> by <a href="https://github.com/cart">@cart</a> is a brand new, refreshingly simple data-driven
game engine built in Rust. It aims to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capable</strong>: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set.</li>
<li><strong>Simple</strong>: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible
for power users.</li>
<li><strong>Data Focused</strong>: Data-oriented architecture using
the Entity Component System paradigm.</li>
<li><strong>Modular</strong>: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like.</li>
<li><strong>Fast</strong>: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel.</li>
<li><strong>Productive</strong>: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>These last few weeks have been big for the Bevy project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bevy was announced and <a href="https://bevyengine.org">open sourced on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Bevy's features were introduced in the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy">&quot;Introducing Bevy&quot;</a>
blog post.</li>
<li>Had a staggering number of people join the community.
This required some quick planning to handle the new size,
which they outlined in the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/scaling-bevy">Scaling Bevy</a> blog post.</li>
<li>Added an official <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/awesome-bevy">awesome-bevy repo</a>
with a huge number of community plugins, games, apps, and learning materials.</li>
<li>Rapier, a new pure-rust physics engine,
released an <a href="https://www.dimforge.com/blog/2020/08/25/announcing-the-rapier-physics-engine/#reaching-out-to-other-communities-bevy-and-javascript">official Bevy plugin</a>.</li>
<li>Thanks to the generosity of individuals and companies, they quickly met
their first two funding goals on @cart's <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart">Github Sponsors page</a>:
&quot;sustainable development&quot; and &quot;@cart makes minimum wage working on Bevy&quot;.</li>
<li>Bevy received a glowing review from the Amethyst Engine team and they agreed
to collaborate in certain areas.
See the <a href="https://community.amethyst.rs/t/bevy-engine-addressing-the-elephant-in-the-room">Addressing the Elephant in the Room</a>
thread on the Amethyst forum for more details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bevy users started sharing their work
on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/692648638823923732">Bevy Discord showcase channel</a>:</p>
<p><img src="bevy_showcase.png" alt="bevy showcase" /></p>
<p>In addition to the initial Bevy GitHub release, 114 pull requests
were merged this month. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>A custom <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/384">async task system for Bevy</a>,
which significantly improves CPU usage and paves the way for future async work.</li>
<li>Refactored data-driven ECS shader code to make it more maintainable, fix some bugs,
and ready to be optimized via the ECS change detection apis.</li>
<li>Support for &quot;logical or&quot; ECS queries as a compliment to the default &quot;logical and&quot;.</li>
<li>Numerous CI improvements.</li>
<li>Use shaderc to compile shaders for iOS builds.</li>
<li>GLTF loading improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bevy also made good progress on its three focus areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/254">Editor-Ready UI</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/179">Physically Based Rendering (PBR)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/255">Scenes</a></li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pistondevelopers/piston">Piston</a> is a modular game engine written in Rust.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://discord.gg/TkDnS9x">Piston Discord Channel</a> has been set up
for the Piston project.</p>
<p>Piston consists of a core library &quot;piston&quot; which itself are composed of
smaller libraries for abstracting input, window and event loop.
This design helps reducing breaking changes in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The core library <code>pistoncore-input</code> is now stabilized and reached 1.0!
This is the most important core abstraction, because it glues all
libraries that are not independent of the core.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://github.com/pistondevelopers/dyon">Dyon</a> is a rusty dynamically typed scripting language.
It is developed and maintained as part of the Piston project,
but can be used as a standalone library.</p>
<p>Dyon is designed from the bottom up to be a good gamedev scripting language for Rust.
It uses a lifetime checker instead of garbage collection, a mutability checker,
optional namespaces and ad-hoc types, named argument syntax,
4D vectors and HTML colors, plus a lot more features!</p>
<p>Recently, Dyon got better macro integration for native Rust types
using <code>#</code> as a prefix.
Here is an example of this feature is being tested in
an experimental offline 3D renderer (not open sourced):</p>
<pre data-lang="txt" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-txt "><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span>// Called by `set_simple(scene: _, sdf: _, id: _)`.
</span><span>dyon_fn!{fn set_simple__scene_sdf_id(
</span><span>    scene: #&amp;mut SimpleScene,
</span><span>    sdf: #&amp;Sdf,
</span><span>    id: f64
</span><span>) {
</span><span>    scene.sdfs[id as usize] = sdf.clone()
</span><span>}}

<p><a href="https://github.com/pistondevelopers/graphics">Piston-Graphics</a> is a library for 2D graphics, written in Rust,
that works with multiple backends.</p>
<p><code>Stencil::Increment</code> has been added and the ecosystem
has been updated to the latest version.</p>
<hr />
<p>The research branch of the Piston project, AdvancedResearch,
has released a new ECS library <a href="https://github.com/advancedresearch/nano_ecs">Nano-ECS</a>.</p>
<p>This ECS design stores all components in a single array
and uses bit masks for enabling/disabling components.
An entity can have maximum 64 components and must be initialized
with all components it uses in the future.
Each entity has a slice into the array that stores all components.
The <code>World</code> object, <code>Component</code> and systems are generated using macros.</p>
<p>One research project with Nano-ECS is to prototype a UI framework
for Rust with a UI editor (not open sourced yet).
This project uses Piston-Graphics by default,
but can generate draw commands for processing by other 2D APIs.
It is also possible to override rendering of widgets for
custom looks with Piston-Graphics, which is often useful in gamedev.
Recently, this project has gotten to a place where
<a href="https://twitter.com/PistonDeveloper/status/1299840279374110720">tree-view interaction</a> is working.</p>
