<em>vange-rs on wgpu-0.10</em></p>
<p>Vange-rs is a rewrite of the iconic Vangers game from 1998 in Rust, heavily
utilizing GPU for rendering.</p>
<p>The rendering engine has seen a major upgrade. Essential shaders were rewritten
into <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/wgsl/">WGSL</a>, which streamlined the shader pipelines and culled out the
dependency tree. Code was ported on the latest <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a>-0.10 release and helped
identify a few issues. Most importantly, this change made the game able to
finally be distributed, and maybe even compiled for the Web in the future. Read
more on the <a href="https://vange.rs/2021/08/25/pure-rust.html">WGSL-related blog post</a>.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of the new superpowers, the <a href="https://kvark.itch.io/vangers">Rusty Vangers</a> game (the
new working title) was published on Itch.io.</p>

<p>Liminal Lab 000 (<a href="https://pebazium.web.app/">live version</a>) by <a href="https://github.com/Pebaz">@pebaz</a> is a tiny, minimalistic
puzzle game with 1 puzzle designed around the concept of <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Liminal_Space">Liminal
Spaces</a>. Liminal Spaces are usually abandoned, transitional places
where life once thrived. These spaces are somehow familiar to the viewer but the
viewer has never been there. The unsettling feeling of being alone comes from
the realization that the viewer does not belong in that space but is merely
passing through it.</p>
<p>Liminal Lab 000 was built using <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad">Macroquad</a>, utilizes voxel rendering
with 8x8x8 chunks, and is hosted on Google Firebase Hosting.</p>

fewer audio/performance issues running the executables versus the browser

adding new levels, new music, and adding a narrator who does an OK job of keeping
score.</p>

<p>Sombervale (<a href="https://github.com/blipjoy/sombervale">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://blipjoy.itch.io/sombervale">itch.io</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blipjoy">Twitch</a>) by
<a href="https://github.com/blipjoy">@blipjoy</a> is a game built in seven days for Rusty Jam. It is styled like an old
handheld game with a 160x128 screen resolution and 16-color palette.</p>
<p>The top 3 things that went well for this project were the art, tilemap support,
and ECS. On the art side, the silhouettes in the background turned out better
than expected. The backlighting (or at least the impression of backlighting)
looks quite nice, even in motion. Tilemap support was added near the end of the
jam built on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tiled">tiled</a>. It catapulted development progress from seeing major
changes every day to making major changes every hour. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/shipyard">shipyard</a> is the Entity
Component System crate used in Sombervale. This had a tricky learning curve, but
simplified complex interactions between entities.</p>
<p>Something that went poorly was choosing a scope that couldn't possibly be
completed on time. As usual, everything turned into a stretch goal! Secondly, a
lot of time was allocated to features that didn't make the cut. Much of this was
a result of trying to be perfect instead of efficient. It's a good game jam
lesson that often has to be relearned the hard way.</p>

management, and carrot production, built with Rust using the Godot game engine!</p>
<p>This month has seen a lot of activity: More improvements to the level editor,
in-game assets, and general gameplay improvements. But the main focus has been on
a new building system with improved ergonomics. The game is now approaching a
point where all the core mechanics for the factory simulation are in place, but
more in-game content and assets are still required to reach the first playable
demo.</p>

a 2D game made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/rusty-jam">Rusty Jam 21</a> in just one week with the
theme &quot;<em>Illusion of Security</em>&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tony is a young man. Finally having his own apartment is a good thing! He will
learn how to live by himself and how to enjoy the small things in life like
playing on his old retro computer: the Astaria 3600 running SafeOS 3.1.</p>
<p>However, you will quickly realize that the internet is not so friendly. You
will meet new people in the Labyrinth(TM) game, and not being friendly to them
can have a serious impact on your real life!</p>
<p>In Murder-User Dungeon you will juggle between exploring the Labyrinth(TM)
game in your console, hiding from vengeful gamers and making sure you fulfill
your human needs.</p>
<p>To win the game, you must reach the end of the Labyrinth(TM)!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers aimed to make the player feel that they were safe in their
apartment at first - however as the game goes on and the player makes enemies of
other gamers in the Labyrinth, they risk them coming to their apartment to get
revenge.</p>
<p>The team split development of the game, so that each member could work
independently on separate features. While <a href="https://github.com/cdsupina">@cdsupina</a> worked on the
needs system and the graphics, <a href="https://github.com/Sheepyhead">@Sheepyhead</a> worked on the UI and
menus, and <a href="https://nightlyside.github.io/">@Nightlyside</a> worked on the console and Labyrinth
gameplay.</p>
<p>MUD was developed using the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy game engine</a>, Rapier2D for

<em>All mobs ported to Bevy Theta Wave</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thetawavegame/thetawave">Theta Wave</a> is an open-source space shooter game by developers <a href="https://twitter.com/micah_tigley">@micah_tigley</a>
and <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosupina">@carlosupina</a>. In the past month, they have been working towards porting
Theta Wave to the Bevy Engine. Most of the work this month has been focused on
implementing all of the existing mobs in Bevy and Rapier.</p>
<p>Progress on this port is going strong - you can find the GitHub issue for the

<a href="https://twitter.com/shrm_kingdom">Twitter</a>) is an upcoming play-to-earn video game built with web
technologies running on the <a href="https://near.org">NEAR Blockchain</a>.</p>
<p>This month the <a href="https://whitepaper.shroomkingdom.net/">whitepaper draft</a> has been published and a lot
of thoughts have been put into the token economics and how to integrate the game
with the blockchain. The Shroom Kingdom DAO (Decentralised Autonomous
Organization) is looking for self-motivated people, who want to help build the
project. DAO members will be rewarded with the $SHRM token, which will soon be
launched on the NEAR mainnet after the final feedback round from NEAR core team
members.</p>
<p>A Proof of Concept has also been published for the app, which will be built with
Bevy and Rapier compiled to WebAssembly and which uses React for the GUI.</p>
<p>To incentivise early adoption of the project, an <a href="https://shroomkingdom.net/blog/nft-airdrop/">NFT airdrop</a>
has been announced. The NFT will only be acquirable for a limited amount of
time.</p>

in order to survive, adding elements of gameplay like gathering resources, and
maintaining the player character health and hunger, which are common for the
genre, finally having the implementation of the monsters and fear system as a
way to further address the first Rusty Jam's theme &quot;Illusion of Security&quot;. <a href="https://gitlab.com/mdaffin/tbd/-/issues?scope=all&amp;state=closed">Read

<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In August, lots of preparation was done to get Veloren ready for the 0.11
release coming in September. Work was done on refactoring parts of the codebase,
and making server administration more ergonomic. Towers were added, which allow
for above-ground dungeons. Skill trees were tweaked for better progression.
Modular weapons had a heavy amount of work put into them and were recently
merged. Work was done to prevent the camera from clipping through walls as much.</p>
<p>Improvements were made to the physics system, as well as other optimizations to
the real-time simulation system. Terrain persistence was completed and is now
being tested on the main server. Balancing was done to loot tables, and more
animations were added to characters. In September, 0.11 will be released. Come
out to the <a href="https://opencollective.com/veloren/events/veloren-0-11-release-party-05c1a306">release party on the 11th at 18:00 UTC</a>!</p>

out of Early Access a few weeks ago.
While the game itself isn't written in Rust,
its <a href="https://humankind-encyclopedia.games2gether.com/en-us">gorgeous encyclopedia</a> and persona sharing service
<a href="https://twitter.com/SobertKaos/status/1429812457820786694">are written using rocket.rs</a>.</p>
<p>Since the encyclopedia has a big constraint of being used inside an embedded
in-game browser that has a bit of performance issues with full JS frameworks
the team opted for server-side rendering with the <a href="https://github.com/Keats/tera">Tera</a> template framework.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had people working on that without any prior rust experience,
and they were ready to code in no time thanks to good language documentation
&amp; useful compiler messages.</p>
<p>We didn't do anything particularly complex, but the safety of Rust combined
with performance enabled us to make this run for way less $$.
You don't have to do complex system programming to profit from Rust's benefits.</p>

<p>The release comes at a cost of DX11 backend, which isn't there comparing to
