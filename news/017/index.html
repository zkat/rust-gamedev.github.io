<p>In <a href="http://santa.abstreet.org">15-minute Santa</a>, you deliver presents around a city,
occasionally stopping at a restaurant to refuel -- biking uphill in the snow
isn't easy! The game uses real data from OpenStreetMap and local GIS sources to
know where shops, single-family homes, and apartments are located. In places
where zoning rules keep people separated from food, Santa will have a hard
time.</p>
<p>15-minute Santa was created by the <a href="https://abstreet.org">A/B Street</a> team as an experiment
to see how quickly we could build a simple arcade game that gets people
thinking about how their city is designed. <a href="https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/tree/master/santa/src/">The code</a> doesn't make
use of an entity-component system or an existing engine, and animation and
particle effects don't use a custom shader. The game runs natively on Linux,
Mac, and Windows, and on web browsers. There are instructions for modding the
game and adding your own city!</p>
<p>A/B Street updates will return next month. In the meantime, please comment on
the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oV4mdtb0ve-wf0HqbEvR9IwXLIkTeDu8a3UnJxnr2F0">2021 roadmap</a>.</p>

meant to be a drop-in replacement for the original game executable
(both freeware and commercial version), focused on being a portable modding
tool (most Cave Story mods patch the executable directly, including machine
code editing/assembly hacks) and adding various visual and gameplay-related
enhancements.</p>
<p>Built mainly using modified <a href="https://ggez.rs">ggez</a> crate, runs on desktop and Android.</p>
<p>Changes done during the last month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/kh79r1/made_my_rust_remake_of_cave_story">An Android port with full touchscreen controls</a>.</li>
<li>Work has been started on Lua API, meant for building custom stuff
on top of the engine.</li>
<li>Work started on pushing the project's changes upstream and moving back
to mainline versions of crates.</li>
<li>Improvements to the Organya player (a simple synthesizer that plays the
in-game music using a set of 100 waves and 6 drum samples).</li>
<li>A bunch of missing NPCs, bosses, and other stuff were added.</li>
<li>The way how game loop works was redesigned, in preparation
for adding networked multiplayer support.</li>

<p><a href="https://sdfgeoff.itch.io/swoop">Swoop</a> by <a href="https://github.com/sdfgeoff">@sdfgeoff</a> is a procedural racing web game
written in Rust from scratch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've tried to make games in a variety of engines, but invariably got frustrated.
So I decided to throw out the engine and find out what makes game-making so complex.
It turns out that the stuff below the game engine is only slightly less friendly
than the stuff above it.</p>
<p>All up this game was a large experiment:
I'm not all that familiar with Rust, it was my first go at targetting WASM,
I've never used WebGL before, and my linear algebra is worse than I thought.</p>

<p><a href="https://etg.dek.im">openEtG</a> is an open source engine that is an HTML5 successor to the original
<a href="http://elementsthegame.com">Elements the Game</a>, featuring additional cards and balance.
In December, 10k lines of JavaScript source were rewritten in Rust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall I've been brainstorming this change for a couple years. So I'd already
shifted from a classical OOP mess with Shield/Weapon/Pillar inheriting from
Permanent to one where everything is a Thing. This also made sense because in
openEtG there's spells like Flying Weapon which convert the player's weapon
into a creature. So before I'd create a new Creature filled in with stats from
original weapon, whereas now it's mostly just moving the instance into a
creature slot &amp; updating its type tag.</p>

Legion is being currently integrated into the <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst">Amethyst game engine</a>,

From the author:</p>

<p>The point isn't that we specifically care about drawing the triangle.
That's just a goal that's easy to grasp.
The point is that we're doing it with no dependencies as a way
to get ourselves to learn about low level OS interaction details as we go.

please feel free to use crates in normal situations.</p>

you suddenly have to learn how to do everything yourself.</p>

<p>Thermite is a WIP SIMD library focused on providing portable SIMD (Single
Instruction, Multiple Data) acceleration of SoA (Structure of Arrays)
algorithms, using consistent-length SIMD vectors for lockstep iteration and
computation. Extensive research and work have gone into minimizing wasted CPU
cycles and making the most out of what your CPU can do.</p>
<p>The goal of Thermite is to provide highly optimized feature-rich backends for
SSE2, SSE4.2, AVX and AVX2, with planned support for AVX512, ARM/Aarch64 NEON,
and WASM SIMD extensions. In addition to that, Thermite will include a highly
optimized vectorized math library with many special math functions and
algorithms, specialized for both single and double precision.</p>
<p>Thermite has been worked on for a little over a month now. The AVX2 backend and
vectorized math library are almost fully implemented. Pre-AVX2/WASM/ARM backends
are a work in progress. The latest documentation is available

</h3>
<p><a href="https://ggez.rs">ggez</a> is a lightweight game framework for making 2D games with minimum
friction. Work has continued towards the next stable release,
incorporating last-minute API changes and fixes. The intended plan is
to freeze the API this month and make a release candidate for people to
play with it and try it out, then fix bugs and incorporate feedback into
a 0.6.0 release.</p>

<p>Last month <a href="https://github.com/lowenware/dotrix">Dotrix</a> got a major feature boost that made the engine ready for
3D games development. To demonstrate the features, the <a href="https://github.com/lowenware/dotrix/blob/main/examples/demo/demo.rs">demo example</a>
was turned into an all-in-one proof-of-concept application.
You can see the full version on <a href="https://youtu.be/KXOr_KxMNWM">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>In less than 300 lines of Rust code (including comments) you can get a game
prototype with an animated character, that you can control using your keyboard
and mouse, run it across some flat terrain, surrounded by a skybox with a
light source.</p>

<em>Sample images rendered by path tracing.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ekzhang/rpt">rpt</a> by <a href="https://www.ekzhang.com/">@ekzhang</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scanhex">@scanhex</a> is a physically based, CPU-only rendering
engine written in Rust. It uses path tracing to generate realistic images of 3D
scenes.</p>
<p>There's a lot of features, including kd-tree mesh acceleration, physical
material properties (microfacet BSDF with multiple importance sampling), HDRI
environment maps, OBJ/MTL/STL files, depth of field, and particle physics
simulation.</p>
<p>It's also parallelized with <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">rayon</a> and available as a library on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>.
The entire source code, including code for the above examples and more, is very
short (~3K SLOC). Future directions include extending the renderer with
bidirectional path tracing and other features.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/stefandevai/textyle">Textyle</a> by <a href="https://github.com/stefandevai">Stefan Devai</a> is a simple web-based tilemap editor
for 2D games built using React JS and Rust (WASM).</p>
<p>You can try it out now <a href="https://textyle.app/edit">in the browser</a>.</p>
<p>Textyle aims to simplify and speed up the process of making tilemaps for your
games. Running on the web means that you don't have to download any additional
tools for creating your maps, and exporting it to an easy format means that you
don't have to add additional libraries or plugins to your game.</p>
<p>React JS was used for the UI, WebGL for the rendering and Rust compiled to WASM
for the tilemap logic and algorithms. Right now most of the code is JavaScript,
however, most of the features in the roadmap will take advantage of Rust and
WASM. The project is in its initial stages of development, expect great
improvements to come!</p>
