<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In November, Veloren started a new initiative to help new developers learn more
about the codebase; the Veloren Reading Club. You can watch the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpXwYEe_LWo">first</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8XayRvVBEs">second</a> sessions
now. Hats were merged, and a major rewrite of the server-hosting section of the
book happened. New textures were made for item drops. Some concept art was
created for what massive cities could look like. Dynamic weather was added, and
you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZwfaohynvc">watch that in action</a>.</p>
<p>Experience sharing went through a large overhaul to evenly distribute EXP gained
across groups. The difficulty of dungeons was adjusted to be more balanced for
new players. Persistence was added to skills, and measures were put in place to
help with future migrations to new skill trees. Work was done on site2, the
system that is used to generate structures procedurally. This will help
make the variance more dynamic by adding more parameters that can be adjusted.
In December, Veloren will release 0.12, hopefully with some holiday spirit!</p>

faster and better quality game visuals - more about that in <a href="https://psichix.github.io/Oxygengine/concepts/ha-renderer/introduction.html#material-graph-based-rendering">Material Graph

<a href="https://twitter.com/GraphiteEditor">Twitter</a>) is an in-development vector and raster graphics
editor built on a non-destructive node-based workflow.</p>
<p>The previously announced Alpha release was delayed as core devs returned to
school - January is the new goal. Development now continues to pick up speed.
Design of the project website has continued for its launch soon, alongside the
Alpha release.</p>
<p>The project upgraded to the Rust 2021 edition and made big improvements to the
frontend TypeScript and web infrastructure. The editor UI is now fully
responsive at small window sizes. Unsaved document tabs display an <code>*</code> and warn
before closing the window. Ruler measurements now move and scale with the
document. And the new snapping system helps draw/move shapes aligned with
others.</p>

<em>A <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=GuVM3W9Pfdg">demo video</a> of using the editor</em></p>
<p><a href="https://solidengine.org/solid-editor">Solid Editor</a> is <a href="https://solidengine.org">Solid Engine</a>'s custom-built voxel
graphics editor. It is designed to be a key part of the engine's asset pipeline,
enabling the creation of game-ready voxel graphics assets. Since the engine part
is pretty far from being done, the author decided to release this editor as a
standalone application.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides being natively compatible with Solid Engine, the editor sports some
generally interesting and unique features.</p>
<ul>
<li>True WYSIWYG editing. The editor scene is rendered using Solid Engine's path
tracer in real-time, yielding realistic lighting while editing.</li>
<li>The possibility to edit voxels directly in 3D, by using any brightly colored
ball as a 3D pointing device. Read more about the <a href="https://solidengine.org/ball-pointer">Ball
Pointer</a>.</li>
<li>A novel approach to editor tools. Instead of many different tools with
overlapping functionality (e.g. &quot;draw square&quot; vs. &quot;select square&quot;, or
&quot;bucket fill&quot; vs. &quot;magic wand&quot;) there is only one, a versatile Selection
tool. Different effects can be applied to the selected voxels, producing the
same results as regular editor tools. Combined with real-time effect
preview, the user experience is very similar to that of classic graphics
editors, with the added benefit of being able to tweak every edit before
applying it.</li>

is a Rust library that provides bindings for the Godot game engine.</p>
<p>November has been a month of refactoring for godot-rust. The API was cleaned up
across different locations, reducing confusion and making the library more
accessible:</p>
<ul>
<li>The module simplification (<a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/811">#811</a>) continued initial efforts on the
module structure, such as shorter paths and avoidance of redundant re-exports.
Some differences between v0.9.3 and now can be seen in the above picture.</li>
<li>Several core symbols were renamed for consistency (<a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/815">#815</a>):
<code>RefInstance</code> -&gt; <code>TInstance</code> and <code>TypedArray</code> -&gt; <code>PoolArray</code>, among others.</li>
<li>Another refactoring affects the <code>Variant</code> conversion methods (<a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/819">#819</a>).
Instead of <code>Variant::to_i64()</code> which may silently fail and return a default
value (Godot behavior), the recommended method is now <code>Variant::to&lt;T&gt;()</code>. This
enables genericity and is more idiomatic in Rust, returning an <code>Option</code> to
indicate success or failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a binding to a C++ library, one topic godot-rust has to deal with is the use
of <code>unsafe</code>, which sometimes boils down to a trade-off between safety and
ease-of-use. Even though Rust provides basic guidelines, there are different
philosophies on their execution, see <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/the-cxx-debate">The CXX Debate</a> for an example. To
discuss how APIs interacting with Godot can be as ergonomic as possible while
preserving safety, <a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/808">issue #808</a> was opened.</p>

<li>Added NavFreeGrid structure to find paths on cells put in free layout manner
