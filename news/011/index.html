<em>Animation improvements</em></p>
<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In June, Veloren did a big interview with GamingOnLinux, be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/06/interviewed-veloren-an-upcoming-foss-multiplayer-voxel-rpg">check it
out</a>! Veloren's lead artist also started a weekly blog
about his work on Veloren, which you can see <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/weekly-blog-no-1-37819335">here</a>. Veloren recently
reached the <a href="https://gitlab.com/explore/projects/starred">first page</a> of most starred projects on Gitlab! The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmRjlnKnSRRihWPPNasl_Qw">Veloren Youtube channel</a> also reached 1000
subscribers.</p>
<p>A lot has been done over the last month towards 0.7, which is slated to release
at the beginning of August. Lots of work has been done improving UI and
animations. These will help towards the goal of 0.7 being the &quot;progression&quot;
update. Many improvements have been made to the continuous integration system to
make it more reliable and faster. Mac support was added to Airshipper, the
Veloren launcher. Significant work was done on the world simulation front. This
includes economic simulations that will represent trade and resource pricing in
settlements and cities. Castle generation is also now in the works.</p>
<p><img src="veloren2.jpeg" alt="Work on castle generation" /></p>
<p>Test coverage and documentation has started to improve, and a workflow around it
is being developed. The project is now hosting a <a href="https://docs.veloren.net/veloren_voxygen/index.html">proper documentation
site</a> that is updated with each merge. A #ux working group was
created to facilitate discussions on improvements to player interactions in
Veloren. Lots of translations were merged, including Swedish, Polish, and
Brazilian Portugese. The skill system is moving on to implementation, being a
coordinated effort between the game design, art, and combat working groups.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/netcan/AnimalChess">Animal Fight Chess</a> (斗兽棋, &quot;Doe Show Chee&quot;) by <a href="https://github.com/netcan">@netcan</a>
is a Rust implementation of a popular Chinese game.</p>
<p>To win the game, one player must successfully move any animal into
the Den(兽穴) of the opponent or eat all animals of the opponent.
The basic move is just one space either forward, backward, left, or right.
The pieces never move diagonally.
Each player has eight pieces,
<a href="http://ancientchess.com/graphics-rules/dou_shou_qi_jungle_game-pieces-values.jpg">different animals with different degrees of power</a>,
a larger power piece can eat a little power piece, but rat can eat elephant.
Here's a picture of the pieces, their English names,
and relative powers indicated by a number.

they plant flowers which gives them points.</p>

<p>Just what everyone's always wanted, <a href="https://github.com/overdrivenpotato/rust-psp">Rust on the Sony PSP</a>! 😆</p>
<p>This project is a port and improvement of the unofficial C/C++ PSPSDK from
2005 It does not require a custom GCC toolchain to be installed. Only Rust
nightly and a cargo subcommand.</p>
<p>The psp crate provides a <code>psp::sys</code> submodule that houses the entire Sony PSP
API. The authors are working to have these interfaces merged into the libc crate.
The PSP, unfortunately, uses non-standard dynamic linking,
(and some libraries are statically linked!), so function definitions
marked extern are not enough. Eventually, this sys lib will be wrapped with a more
rust-friendly library.</p>
<p>Rather than patching LLVM or rustc, the rust-psp team has also merged a
<code>mipsel-sony-psp</code> target upstream, and published cargo-psp. This is a subcommand
that works exactly like cargo build, except it also builds the crate into a
PSP-specific executable format called <code>PRX</code> and packages that into an
<code>EBOOT.PBP</code>, the standard format for a PSP Homebrew.</p>
<p>The crate has reached full user-mode parity with the unofficial C/C++ SDK.
Kernel-mode support still needs to be worked on. Aside from library
imports, there is also support for PSP-specific custom assembly instructions
via the <code>vfpu_asm!</code> macro, with no need for a custom compiler toolchain.
There is also optional <code>embedded-graphics</code> support and a function to benchmark
or time your code.</p>
<p>The next major milestone for rust-psp is std support.
If you are interested in helping out, please feel free to join the rust-psp
channel in the <a href="https://discord.gg/WY8XhDG">PSP Homebrew discord server</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs">glam</a> is a simple and fast linear algebra crate for games and graphics.</p>
<p>This month <a href="https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#090---2020-06-28">glam 0.9</a> was published to crates.io. This update is a breaking
change from 0.8.</p>
<p>In 0.9 the <code>Vec3</code> type was changed from being a 128 byte SIMD vector type to a
tuple of three floats. This changes the size of <code>Vec3</code> from 16 bytes to 12 bytes
and the alignment from 16 bytes to 4 bytes. This might not affect all users but
if <code>Vec3</code> was used in a context where the size or alignment mattered, such as in
FFI or as input to shaders, this could cause breakage.</p>
<p>The SIMD parts of <code>Vec3</code> were moved to a new type, <code>Vec3A</code> (<code>A</code> for Aligned)
which is 16 byte aligned and thus 16 bytes in size.  The <code>Vec3A</code> type is still
there for users who want the performance benefits of the SIMD implementation.</p>
<p>The motivation for this change was that it is potentially surprising and
confusing for new users that the <code>Vec3</code> type was not 12 bytes. Also, it's common
that users needed a <code>Vec3</code> that was just 12 bytes.</p>
<p>While glam is reasonably stable it has not yet reached a 1.0 release so it
seemed like now is the time to address such issues in the API.</p>

<p>While the project itself started earlier this year, with this month's release
<code>yaks</code> gained an overhauled API, further leaning into the promise of
simplicity:</p>
<ul>
<li>systems are any functions or closures of a specific signature,</li>
<li><code>Executor</code> is a container for one or more systems,</li>
<li>system execution order can be defined when building an <code>Executor</code>
to create concurrent chains of systems,</li>
<li>resources used by systems (any data that is not associated with an entity)
are now borrowed for the duration of execution, instead of being owned
by the framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>All items in the library are exhaustively documented, and the repository
contains a fully annotated example.</p>
<p>Enabled-by-default <code>parallel</code> cargo feature can be disabled to force
everything in <code>yaks</code> to become single-threaded, which allows using code
written with the framework on platforms without threading - notably, web.</p>

<p>Arsenal currently has a <a href="https://github.com/katharostech/arsenal/releases/tag/v0.1.0">POC</a> working, but there is no support for
adding custom game logic. The next major step for Arsenal is to get initial
<a href="https://github.com/leudz/shipyard/issues/96">scripting support</a> in Shipyard. The scripting plan for
Arsenal borrows heavily from the <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/rfcs/blob/master/0001-scripting.md">Amethyst scripting RFC</a>
with the first target scripting language being Python. Other languages that are

<p>Just an interesting Rust gamedev link from the past. :)</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aKLntZcp27M"><img src="ecs-talk.png" alt="a screenshot of the first slide" /></a></p>
<p>During RustConf 2018, Catherine West gave a keynote talk
&quot;Using Rust For Game Development&quot; that introduced a lot of people
to the concept of ECS and is now considered a classic.
You can <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aKLntZcp27M">watch the recording here</a> (<a href="https://kyren.github.io/rustconf_2018_slides/index.html">slides</a>).</p>
<p>A few months later <a href="https://kyren.github.io/2018/09/14/rustconf-talk.html">an extended text version was released</a>.</p>
