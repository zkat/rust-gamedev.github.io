<em>Rusty Vangers engine in action within the original game</em></p>
<p><a href="https://vange.rs">Rusty Vangers</a> by <a href="https://github.com/kvark/">@kvark</a> is a modern re-implementation of the original
<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/vangers">Vangers</a> game from the last century.
It's in Rust, and uses GPU and multiple threads heavily.</p>
<p>Something incredible has been brewing within the small but dedicated community
of the original game. They prototyped a pluggable rendering interface in order
to support rendering the game via <a href="https://vange.rs">Rusty Vangers</a> instead of the default
CPU-based rasterizer. The plugin is made as a static library sub-crate with a
bunch of C-exported functions.
The approach worked for the terrain, so the mini working group transitioned
to moving more visual features off the old path and into the Rust-based plugin.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://vange.rs">Rusty Vangers</a> engine got a number of important
fixes and additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>water is rendered fair as transparent surfaces</li>
<li>lighting evaluation on the second layer is fixed</li>
<li>dynamic terrain and palette modification is supported</li>
<li>custom viewport support</li>
<li>can render menu screens, not just the game levels</li>
</ul>

<em>A light to keep the night away</em></p>
<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In January, another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR2WDBMjkh8">Veloren Reading Club was
recorded</a>! The <code>entity_sync</code> system was refactored to
be parallel. This was the largest bottleneck during the last release party, and
this fix will allow us to more easily surpass the 200 player mark on the server.
Work has been done to improve dagger animations. Sounds for flowing rivers are
now more bubbly sounding. Work is happening to get the OpenGL renderer to work
with WGPU for Veloren, as the project transitioned to Vulkan, but wants to keep
backward compatibility for older GPUs.</p>
<p>Skiing and ice skating have gotten to a playable state. The mounts system was
overhauled to make it more ergonomic to work with, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJpeOJT78TI">watch a video of
that here</a>. Several experimental shaders have been
added, along with a &quot;point glow&quot; which help lanterns look better. With these new
shaders, swimming underwater is a whole new experience! A tracking issue was
created for worldgen issues that will help coordinate direction for some large
systems in the future.</p>

is a realistic sailing/foiling inshore simulator in development for PC/Steam
that will put you in the driving seat of modern competitive sailing.</p>
<p>The last couple of months saw great disappointment for the failed port to WGPU
due to unexpected performance losses compared to the old renderer. The game is
now back to its original DirectX 11 renderer.</p>
<p>February will see the beginning of the private alpha testing program, an
exciting opportunity to gather the first feedback about boat handling and
controls before diving into one of the most challenging tasks of the game:
sailing rules implementation.</p>
<p>Content-wise, Hong Kong will soon join Den Haag as a race location while the
racecourse is becoming more and more alive with the addition of spectators
boats. The playable foiling catamaran Jx50 is also constantly getting graphical
updates and physics tweaks.</p>
<p>Hydrofoil Generation is scheduled to release on Steam Early Access in Summer</p>

is a Rust library that provides bindings for the Godot game engine.</p>
<p>The start of 2022 is a good opportunity to showcase a few godot-rust games in
development. More info is available in <a href="https://godot-rust.github.io/book/projects/games.html">the book</a>.</p>
<p><img src="godot-rust-games.jpg" alt="godot-rust example games" /></p>
<p>Using custom builds of the Godot engine involved quite a bit of ceremony in the
past: manual CLI invocations, code replacement, and re-wiring of the
<code>gdnative-bindings</code> subcrate. The approach has been fundamentally overhauled,
and is now as simple as specifying the crate feature <code>custom-godot</code>
(<a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/833">#833</a>). The library will automatically look for a <code>godot</code> executable
in the system path (or a <code>GODOT_BIN</code> environment variable), and regenerate
<code>api.json</code>. This makes using older or module-extended Godot versions a breeze.</p>
<p>The latest <code>master</code> branch has now been updated to support Godot 3.4 out of the
box (<a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/829">#829</a>).</p>
<p>Upcoming godot-rust version 0.10 seems to be finally on the horizon, with only a
handful of tasks left (<a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/issues/842">#842</a>). A changelog since v0.9.3 is now
available. The continuous stream of small improvements here and there has led to

focuses on some negative parts of Rust and its ecosystem. There are three key
takeaways from this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay away from low-level libraries if you are not aware of how deep the rabbit
hole goes.</li>
<li>Evaluate the library ecosystem of Rust thoroughly before using it for a
project that requires somewhat exotic functionality.</li>
<li>Rust forces you to care about the details, regardless of whether you want to.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/aclysma/rafx">Rafx</a> is a multi-backend renderer that optionally integrates with the
<a href="https://github.com/amethyst/distill">distill</a> asset pipeline.</p>
<p>Since the previous rafx update in this newsletter (6 months ago!), many new
features have been introduced to improve performance and image quality. The
main rendering pipeline has also been split into &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;basic&quot;
pipelines. Unlike the basic pipeline which focuses on wide compatibility,
the modern pipeline uses forward-clustered lighting and handles hundreds
of shadow-casting lights. It is targeting compute shaders and will be adding
bindless and GPU-driven rendering soon.</p>
<p>Since the last update, the modern pipeline adds GPU-accelerated light binning,
SSAO, shadow map atlasing/caching, TAA with sharpening, and auto-exposure/HDR.
In addition, both modern and basic pipelines now support transparency. A
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWYpX7RGUSA">video demonstrating TAA</a> (temporal anti-aliasing) is
available on youtube.</p>
<p>With these performance improvements, <code>rafx</code> is now able to render challenging
scenes with photorealistic style at 60FPS/1440p on modern, mid-range GPUs.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/Friz64/erupt-bootstrap">erupt-bootstrap</a> by <a href="https://blog.friz64.de/about">@Friz64</a> is a Vulkan Bootstrapping library for Rust.</p>
<p>When starting a new Vulkan project, there's always the struggle of writing a
whole bunch of boilerplate code in order to, e.g., get your first triangle on
the screen. You have to create a <code>VkInstance</code>, with the validation layers
set up and working for development. Then select the best suited
<code>VkPhysicalDevice</code> for your app's requirements. Use that to create a <code>VkDevice</code>
with the appropriate queue families chosen. Oh, and after that, you need
to struggle with managing and resizing a Vulkan swapchain.</p>
<p>That's no fun — and this is where <a href="https://gitlab.com/Friz64/erupt-bootstrap">erupt-bootstrap</a> comes in. It aims to
abstract over all of this to get you up and running in no time. It's inspired by
the excellent <a href="https://github.com/charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap">vk-bootstrap</a> library for C++.</p>

</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/edict">Edict</a> is a new archetype-based ECS implementation by <a href="https://github.com/zakarumych">@zakarumych</a>.</p>
<p>The novel feature of <a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/edict">Edict</a> is entity ownership implemented via reference counting.
This optional feature allows creating owned kind of <code>Entity</code> &quot;reference&quot;,
that ensures the entity is alive and despawns it on drop.
Storing owning <code>Entity</code> in the component of another entity
creates ownership relation between those entities.
Even though <code>Entity</code> is an owning reference,
components of the entity are can be queried from <code>World</code> as usual.
Shared ownership is also available.</p>
<p>Optimized for both high density <code>World</code>s with thousands of entities
and also for <code>World</code>s with a lower number of entities spread among many archetypes.
<a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/edict">Edict</a> is aimed at a wide range of game genres and use cases outside of games.</p>
<p>Built-in change detection with epochs allows systems to query for components
that were updated since the last run of that query,
or since any other epoch as defined by <code>Tracks</code> argument.
This opens the possibility to have multiple POV on changes even in a single system.
For example, server-side netcode can track changes individually
for each client and query for changes since the last ACK.
<a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/edict">Edict</a> optimizes iteration significantly when entities
with modified components are queried.</p>
<p>Although ECS abbreviation implies, <a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/edict">Edict</a> does not come
with predefined <code>System</code> trait and systems scheduler.
We can call it ECQ (Entity-Component-Query) as an alternative to ECS.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/edict">Edict</a> is added to <a href="https://github.com/rust-gamedev/ecs_bench_suite">ecs_bench_suite</a>
so anyone can compare performance in some trivial examples with other ECS.</p>
<p>Development focus for February is making more public API, including unsafe parts,
to allow writing custom queries, implement schedulers with parallel execution, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HouraiTeahouse/backroll-rs">Backroll</a> is a 100% type-safe native Rust implementation of the
<a href="https://www.ggpo.net/">GGPO</a> rollback netcode library. The core library has gone through
superficial updates, but the <a href="https://crates.io/bevy-backroll">Bevy plugin</a> has been
massively overhauled. This update significantly improves the ergonomics of setting
up rollback netcode for your game (no more ugly turbofishes! No more generic type
parameter config type!), provides an automatic way of saving and loading Bevy
components and resources, and fully parallelizes the saving and loading of game
state when a rollback occurs.</p>
