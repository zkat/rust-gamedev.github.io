<em>The new repo banner</em></p>
<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In May, Veloren 0.6 was launched! Check out the launch trailer below for an
overview of the changes. The launch party was a massive success with nearly 50
people online at the peak. In May, character persistence was added. This allows
players to save their level after leaving the server. Dungeons were merged right
before the release, and include bosses. Many small bugs were fixed for the
release as well. Veloren also now has an <a href="https://opencollective.com/veloren">Open Collective
account</a>, and you can donate towards our infrastructure
costs. GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/05/veloren-an-open-source-rpg-inspired-by-cube-world-has-a-new-release">wrote an article</a> on Veloren's development.</p>

<p>Here is the May changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added server-side character saving</li>
<li>Player now starts with a lantern.</li>
<li>Added tab completion in chat for player names and chat commands</li>
<li>Added server persistence for character stats</li>
<li>Added a popup when setting your character's waypoint</li>
<li>Added dungeon arenas</li>
<li>Added dungeon bosses and rare boss loot</li>
<li>Added 2 sets of armour. One Steel and one Leather.</li>
<li>Added context-sensitive crosshair</li>
</ul>
<p>A 0.7 intro meeting was held, in which the devs looked at what they wanted to achieve
with this version. 0.7 will be released August 1st. They came up with a definition
of 0.7, and what they wanted to achieve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a player, I want to get quests from NPCs in settlements. I want to be sent
to kill enemies, collect objects, or complete dungeons. I want to be sent from
village to village and become familiar with the region.</p>
<p>I want to be able to open the map and get information where I need to go for a
quest. I want to be able to easily find where dungeons, villages, and other
points of interest are. I want to be able to open a trade window with NPCs in
villages, and buy and sell items. I want to be able to craft items with
ingredients that I have.</p>
<p>I want to be able to see and hear more while in combat. I want to feel good
while doing combat. I want to see particle effects from magic, and hear swords
clashing together. I want to be able to add people to my combat party and
interact with the game UI to do this.</p>

<p>Paddlers is a multiplayer strategy game with a <a href="https://demo.paddlers.ch/">live prototype</a>
available online to demonstrate its current status.
It is a learning-by-doing hobby project to explore the possibilities with
Rust on the web, developed by a single person so far but open to contributors.</p>
<p>May was a busy month for Paddlers and brought many fundamental changes and new
features, including the ability to observe other player's villages.
A summary of changes is available on the <a href="https://paddlers.ch/news.html">Paddlers news page</a>.</p>
<p>Besides programming, the developer of Paddlers also wrote a blog post called
<a href="https://www.jakobmeier.ch/blogging/Paddlers_4.html">Benefits of full-stack Rust</a> where the details some of his
experiences when implementing a server-client model using Rust on both ends.
Furthermore, he published a first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Syw7hxQ-z0">video teaser</a>.</p>

<p>This unnamed game is still in the prototype stage and
it's the new project of Kunos Simulazioni
(creators of the <a href="https://www.assettocorsa.net">Assetto Corsa</a> racing simulation franchise)
co-founder and former Lead Programmer <a href="https://twitter.com/KunosStefano">Stefano Casillo</a> who started
a new studio (Jaxx Vane Studio) in April 2020 in the search of new challenges.</p>
<p>It's going to be a modern Foiling/Sailing Simulator aiming to bring the depth,
rigor and attention to detail found in racing simulations to the sailing genre
on PC/Windows.
The game features a fully custom scratch made 3D engine written in Rust
with minimal dependencies using DirectX 11 via winapi-rs, ODE
and OpenAL with custom bindings.</p>
<p>The project should leave the prototype stage later next month.
The development is streamed live 3 times a week on <a href="https://twitch.tv/kunosstefano">Twitch</a>
with highlights also published on <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UC7n_g2xDySrmKRaf41rSwlg">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://cyberplant.xyz/posts/may">May</a> devlog was posted.
Some of the updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>The core logic of the plant simulation was rewritten,
allowing for a broader variety of (more adaptable) plants,
with a broader difference in tree growth behavior across different species.</li>
<li>A WIP <a href="%5Bgarden-kaleidoscope%5D">point-cloud drawing tool</a> (currently named Kaleidoscope)
for creating some parts of the game world.</li>
<li>Optimizations: such as reducing the number of objects to be drawn by 90%
(mostly via frustum culling).</li>
<li>Anti-aliasing, new leaves, and textures.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/JMS55/sandbox">Sandbox</a> is a falling sand game by JMS55 that provides a variety of fun
particle types to place, and then you get to watch the resulting interactions!</p>
<p>The main focus so far has been experimenting with different particle types, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sand</li>
<li>Acid - Dissolves material.</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Replicator - Creates infinite copies of other particles.</li>
<li>Plant - Grows over time once placed on wet Sand, or on top of an existing
plant.</li>
<li>Cyrotheum - A cold particle that melts over time, and releases a wave of
cold to its surroundings.</li>
<li>Unstable - Heats up over time, vaporizing a large radius at too high
of a temperature, and releases Smoke.</li>
<li>Electricity - Can only exist when falling, or in Water.
Flows through Water. Very hot.</li>
<li>Glass - Created by heating up Sand. Acts like a liquid at
high enough temperatures, and a solid otherwise. Immune to Acid.</li>
<li>Life - A semi-intelligent particle that stacks itself up, and moves
as a group. Likes to breed upon eating Plants. Will jump down short drops.
Dies if too hot or cold, or upon falling a large distance.</li>
<li>Blood - Created by pressurizing dead Life particles, by stacking
enough of other particles on top.</li>
</ul>
<p>Got any ideas? Leave an <a href="https://github.com/JMS55/sandbox">issue on github</a>, or add it yourself!</p>

to the game engine via WASM bindings, features include: displaying info about
currently selected object, deleting objects, adding any object type, creating
new maps and teleporting to any existing map</li>
<li>Map changes are persisted on the server and location of player is now
restored when closing the client and coming back later</li>

<p>In May, progress was made on the game models. Test have been created in order
to formalize what a testing suite should look like in Akigi. The interactive
sequences system was restructured to allow for a node system that could guide the
player better. A data extraction system was put in place to view metrics from
the game server.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw a post on reddit asking for a simple game dev tutorial with Rust.
Generally people encourage using ECS with any Rust game,
so I guess there’s no tutorials for anything without it.
However, for simple games like Pong or Flappy Bird,
it really is easier to forgo the ECS.</p>
<p>While Amethyst, the biggest Rust game engine,
is completely built on ECS and you can’t make a game without it,
there’s still plenty of small game engines that don’t make any assumptions.
My favorite of these is ggez.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>safe_arch lets you safely use CPU intrinsics - those things in the

It works purely via <code>#[cfg()]</code> and compile time CPU feature declaration.

or use a fallback path based on that then this crate is sadly not for you.</p>
<p>SIMD register types are &quot;newtype'd&quot; so that better trait impls
can be given to them, but the inner value is a pub field so feel
to just grab it out if you need to.
Trait impls of the newtypes include: Default (zeroed), From/Into of appropriate
data types, and appropriate operator overloading.</p>

<li>The majority of nodes have real-time previews</li>
<li>Extensive library of nodes, from math and logic to gradients, transitions,
and animations</li>
<li>Support is currently limited to exporting GLSL shaders, but more languages
and formats are planned</li>
<li>The tool will be released for free, as soon as it's ready</li>

<p>Asset management library that aims to be easy to use, flexible, extensible
and support virtually any use-case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to load compund asset that pulls subassets without boilerplate on
call-site? All heavy-lifting for loading subassets can be done in <code>Format</code>
implementation for the asset type.</li>
<li>Asset is made of GPU resources and access to graphics device is required to
create asset instance? <code>Asset::build</code> receives reference to <code>Asset::Context</code>.</li>
<li>Targeting browser? <code>goods</code> support building for wasm
and even bundle Fetch API based asset data source.</li>
<li>Target doesn't have <code>std</code>? Core types and traits are <code>no_std</code> compatible.
But <code>alloc</code> is required.</li>
<li>Looking to keep things tidy and fast to build? Clean build of the crate
with no features takes about ~3s on modern CPU.</li>
<li>Integration with <code>serde</code> ecosystem? Special <code>Format</code> implementations can load
assets whose representation implement <code>serde::de::DeserializeOwned</code>.
Crate includes <code>Format</code>s for loading assets from JSON, YAML and RON documents.</li>
</ul>

font rendering. They were looking to expand translations to languages that had
different characters, such as Cyrillic or Chinese. This would require support
for cubic bezier curves, not just quadratic curves. You can <a href="https://blog.roboinstruct.us/2020/05/24/the-otf-journey.html">read their
blog</a> for an in-depth explanation. This lead to the release
of <a href="https://twitter.com/bigabgames/status/1258866371024293890">ab_glyph 0.1</a> that supports otf fonts, which then lead to
<a href="https://twitter.com/bigabgames/status/1264235900462075906">glyph_brush 0.7</a> based on this, and finally <a href="https://twitter.com/bigabgames/status/1264557215693918209">otf fonts in
Robo Instructus</a>.</p>
