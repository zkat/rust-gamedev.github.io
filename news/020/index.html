<p><img src="gamedev-meetup.png" alt="Gamedev meetup poster" /></p>
<p>The third Rust Gamedev Meetup happened in March. It was an opportunity for
developers to show off what Rust projects they've been working on in the game
ecosystem. Developers showed off game engine demos, in-game playthroughs,
tooling, and more. You can watch the recording of the meetup <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gqCxt8XL92o">here on
Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>The next meetup will take place on the 10th of April at 16:00 GMT on the <a href="https://discord.gg/yNtPTb2">Rust
Gamedev Discord server</a>, and can also be <a href="https://twitch.tv/rustgamedev">streamed on

<blockquote>
<p>The idea behind SecBot is that an outpost has ceased communications,
so the morally dubious Bracket Corporation dispatch a security bot
to find out what happened.
Upon arrival, it becomes clear that things aren't going well for the colony
- so the player rushes around collecting colonists
and shepherding them back to the spaceship.
I tried to bake some narrative/flavor into the game,
and create a fun game you can enjoy over a coffee-break.</p>

<p>Stellary 2 by <a href="https://twitter.com/CoffeJunkStudio">@CoffeJunkStudio</a> is a 3D real-time space
shooter in which the player has to control his spaceship to colonize each planet
in the solar system.</p>
<p>In the last month, the game concept has been overhauled. Most importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planets become inhabitable over time, starting with the outermost one in order
to bring head-to-head matches to an end eventually.</li>
<li>Full focus on multiplayer, including AIs.</li>
<li>Players can’t die mid-game anymore. When defeated, they re-spawn and lose a
colony for it (if they have one) instead of dying. This prevents long waiting
times when playing against friends.</li>

<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In March, Veloren released 0.9. Lots of work throughout the month was put
towards preparing for this. NPC merchants and trading was merged. Many changes
were made to combat, including buffs and combat. Player-to-player trading was
also implemented. Lots of work was done in optimizing Veloren. This included
significantly improving how long physics was talking, and network improvements.
Metrics tracking was also overhauled to better track the different systems in
Veloren. Pathfinding is also working through an overhaul. A large feature
implemented in March was Airships being merged into the game. This prompted a
redo of how physics in the game is handled.</p>
<p>A survey was sent out in preparation for the release. A lot of information was
gathered about how players experience Veloren, and the items they like or don't
like. These can all be ready in <a href="https://veloren.net/devblog-112">devblog #112</a>.
This was followed up by the 0.9 release, which turned out to be the largest yet.
At peak, 133 players joined the main server. There were problems throughout the
release party relating to networking, as well as our tick performance.</p>

<em>NES Tetris with Hard Drop and Ghost Piece</em></p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.gridbugs.org/reverse-engineering-nes-tetris-to-add-hard-drop">blog post</a> describing the process of reverse-engineering
the rendering and input-handling logic in the NES version of Tetris, and using
a <a href="https://github.com/stevebob/mos6502/blob/master/tetris-hard-drop-patcher/src/main.rs#L23">rust embedded domain-specific language</a> to
make a <a href="https://github.com/stevebob/mos6502/tree/master/tetris-hard-drop-patcher">patching tool</a> that generates code (6502
machine code) to add hard drop (instantly dropping the current piece) and to
render a ghost piece (the dotted outline showing where the current piece will
land).</p>
<p>The patching tool uses the crate
<a href="https://github.com/stevebob/mos6502/tree/master/assembler">mos6502_assembler</a> to specify 6502 assembly in
rust and generate machine code. Many of the reverse-engineering experiments
were done using <a href="https://github.com/stevebob/mos6502/tree/master/nes-emulator">this rust NES emulator</a>. The
result is available as an <a href="https://github.com/stevebob/mos6502/raw/master/tetris-hard-drop-patcher/tetris-hard-drop.ips">IPS Patch</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/StygianLightning/genesis">genesis</a> by <a href="https://github.com/StygianLightning">@StygianLightning</a> is a library for generating statically-typed
ECS worlds by using a procedural macro.</p>
<p>Unlike other ECS libraries and frameworks, which do dynamic borrow-checking
at runtime, you define all your components upfront and generate
a completely statically typed ECS, with borrow checking done at compile time.
Gone are the days of passing a World between functions,
only to encounter a dynamic borrow checking problem!</p>
<p>genesis is a lightweight ECS library that doesn't provide any scheduling capabilities.
Instead, you can query the storage for each component type directly.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Ralith/hecs">hecs</a> is a fast, lightweight, and unopinionated archetypal ECS library.</p>
<p>Version 0.5 introduces a column-major serialization mode. This imitates the
in-memory data layout, enabling higher performance than the already-fast
row-major serialization mode. Because columnar layout places similar data
nearby, it also improves the effectiveness of compression.</p>
<p>Other changes include major optimizations to spawning entities and
adding/removing components, inspired by the archetype graph model recently
adopted by bevy.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/djkoloski/rust_serialization_benchmark">benchmark</a> was put together to compare rkyv
against other leading serialization solutions and gather feedback and use
cases for development. A <a href="https://davidkoloski.me/blog/rkyv-is-faster-than">summary and analysis</a> of the
results is also available.</p>
<p>Version 0.5 is hot off the presses and rolls up features from the 0.4
development cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Derive macros can now implement <code>PartialEq</code> and <code>PartialOrd</code> between
archived and unarchived types.</li>
<li>Custom type bounds for serialization and deserialization can be added
with derive attributes.</li>
<li>Helper types like <a href="https://docs.rs/rkyv/0.5.0/rkyv/struct.AlignedVec.html">AlignedVec</a> and
<a href="https://docs.rs/rkyv/0.5.0/rkyv/struct.Infallible.html">Infallible</a> were introduced to improve ergonomics.</li>

for very efficient loading/rendering at runtime.</p>
<p>Sprite rendering in general is also much faster now. Scenes with 40k-100k
sprites can render at 60fps (measured on M1 mini) depending on
transparency/distinct Z values in the scene. New examples demonstrate tilemap
and sprite rendering.</p>

dynamic memory allocation when working with descriptor sets. Rafx also

want to profile a task, and finally <code>Profiler::end_profiling()</code> once at the end.</p>
