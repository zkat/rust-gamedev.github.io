<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG
inspired by Dwarf Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, the team met for a 0.6 intro meeting.
It was decided that 0.6 would focus on things for the player to do,
and hence will be called &quot;The Content Update&quot;.</p>
<p>Research has been done on multiple areas this month.
One domain is level of detail, which is allowing mountains off in the distance
to be rendered much faster.
Another domain is server persistence.
Finding a way for the server to efficiently persist player information
is a large part of what is needed for The Content Update.</p>
<p>Here is the February changelog:</p>
<pre data-lang="txt" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-txt "><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"><span>- Fixed NPCs attacking the player forever after killing them
</span><span>- Extend run sfx to small animals to prevent sneak attacks by geese
</span><span>- Added sfx for wielding/unwielding weapons
</span><span>- Added new orc hairstyles
</span><span>- Added gamma setting
</span><span>- Configurable fonts

</span><span>- Allow spawning individual pet species, not just generic body kinds
</span><span>- Added daily Mac builds
</span><span>- Removed highlighting of non-collectible sprites
</span><span>- Added zoomable and rotatable minimap

<p><a href="https://github.com/Ruddle/oxidator">Oxidator</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Ruddle">@Ruddle</a> is a real-time strategy game/engine
written with Rust and WebGPU.
It's inspired by Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander, Spring Engine,

<p>The project's goal is to provide a modern, carefully crafted,
minimal and highly constrained set of tools for players/designers
to create mods without programming knowledge.</p>
<p>Some of the current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simulation:
working draft of flock behavior and collision detection,
basic health and damage computation,
construction and repair;</li>
<li>Rendering: basic display of a heightmap &amp; 3D models (with instancing),
fxaa, screen-space reflections;</li>
<li>UI: select units (picking and rectangle selection),
move &amp; build orders;</li>
<li>Multiplayer: working PoC localhost tcp client/server;</li>
<li>Map editor: raise, lower, flatten, blur, noise pencil;</li>
<li>Unit editor: basic editor with joint &amp; mesh selection and parameter editing
(speed, turn rate, health, etc);</li>

<p>The license is GPL-3 and the code is the same

<p><a href="https://github.com/Skytrias/everpuzzle">Everpuzzle</a> is a Tetris Attack like action-puzzle game written in Rust.</p>
<p>Everpuzzle aims to become a similar game like Tetris Attack and expand on its concepts.
The project was recently rewritten with minimal dependencies to achieve small
compile times and gain more control over the underlying engine architecture.
In the past Everpuzzle was using Amethyst with ECS,
however there were some issues that made development difficult.
Everpuzzle's big goals are AI, Multiplayer and different Game modes.</p>
<p>Big changes coming in version 0.2, full list <a href="https://github.com/Skytrias/everpuzzle/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gamepad support (singleplayer)</li>
<li>Multiple grids</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/leod/ultimate-scale">Ultimate Scale</a> is a puzzle game in which you build
increasingly large machines to solve increasingly difficult problems.
The game consists of wind and blips.
Wind propagates along pipes and causes blips to move.
Blips, in turn, activate blocks.</p>
<p><a href="https://leod.github.io/">Leod</a> is currently working on the core design: How to make the game fun and
what blocks to add. He posted about their thoughts and progress on a

performance. This update increases the MSRV to 1.38 and removes the <code>&quot;nightly&quot;</code>
feature.</p>
<p>In this version, the <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/shred/issues/182">panic message has been improved</a> to include
the name of the type that is accessed on stable Rust, as well as suggestions for
how to fix the issue. Prior to <code>specs 0.16</code>, retrieving a resource that had not
been added to the <code>World</code> panics with an obscure <em>&quot;resource not found&quot;</em> message,
and the <code>&quot;nightly&quot;</code> feature was necessary to discover what resource that is.</p>
<p>In addition, the <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/specs/issues/673"><code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> trait constraints are
removed</a> from resources and <code>Component</code>s when the
<code>&quot;parallel&quot;</code> feature is disabled -- enabling types such as
<code>wasm_bindgen::JsValue</code> to be used with non-parallel <code>specs</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Trisfald/weasel">weasel</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Trisfald">@Trisfald</a> is a customizable battle system for turn-based games.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple way to define the combat's rules,
taking advantage of Rust's strong type system.</li>
<li>Battle events are collected into a timeline to support save and restore,
replays, and more.</li>
<li>Client/server architecture; all battle events are verified by the server.</li>
<li>Minimal performance overhead.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea behind this crate is to provide a structured
and safe framework to manage the game state.
Users can create a battle and evolve it by applying events.
Then, weasel takes care of keeping a historical timeline.
It also help with serializing/deserializing save files
or sharing and verifying events between clients and server.
The game logic is defined through traits, which is nice because
it can benefit from Rust's type system and compile time checks.</p>

<p>The process is complex for a lot of reasons:</p>

<li>Graphics is done through the Linux framebuffer &lt;...&gt;</li>
<li>Sound uses old-style Linux OSS &lt;...&gt;</li>

<p>It's a bit clunky, but it works!
There are quite a few devices with very similar hardware
this should work with.
It should be possible to make simple games for such devices,
which I find particularly motivating :)</p>

<p>This month <a href="https://github.com/PsichiX/Oxygengine">Oxygengine</a> got new version 0.7.0 with

modules that allows users to focus on making VN games easily,
with virtually no code needed to be written -
it is a groundbreaking start in developing a set of tools
for the professional game developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As few might notice, Oxygengine is starting to get more complex modules,
there is a reason for that - this engine is made with one big goal in mind,
which is: to became a tool used by professionals,
giving easy way to make complex games easily,
therefore the current milestone is about bringing a basic game editor
with first game maker module along with blueprints-like visual scripting
and animation tool - the most important tools for visual novel game designers!</p>

<p>You can find sources of the project that shows how to use these modules
in the <a href="https://github.com/PsichiX/Oxygengine/tree/master/demos/visual-novel-testbed">engine demo projects</a>.</p>
<p>Another thing that was shipped in last milestone was a module that allows
to make and run your game logic designed in Blueprint-like visual scripting.
Next milestone is focused on delivering a base for professional modular
game editor that will allow users to easily create a complex and animated
Visual Novel games using Visual Scripting -
game makers for another genres are currently in planning stage.</p>

<p>This month the project was renamed and split into many crates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is RLTK, renamed because it is increasingly finding
usage outside of just Roguelikes.
It's also been divided into a number of crates,
to make it easy to pick-and-choose the features you need.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rltk</code> crate wraps bracket-lib and re-exports
in the <code>rltk::</code> and <code>rltk::prelude</code> namespace.
This preserves compatibility with all existing RLTK projects.</li>
<li><code>bracket-algorithm</code>-traits exposes the traits required
for the various algorithm systems in other crates.</li>
<li><code>bracket-color</code> is my RGB/HSV color management system.</li>
<li><code>bracket-geometry</code> exposes various geometric primitives and helpers.
Supports other crates.</li>
<li><code>bracket-noise</code> is a port of Auburn's FastNoise to Rust.</li>
<li><code>bracket-pathfinding</code> provides a high-performance
A* (A-Star) pathing system, as well as Dijkstra maps.</li>
<li><code>bracket-random</code> is a dice-oriented random number generator,
including parsing of RPG-style dice strings such as 3d6+12.</li>
