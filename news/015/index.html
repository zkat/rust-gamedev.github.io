<em>Endless mountains to explore</em></p>
<p><a href="https://veloren.net">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In October, lots of work was done on the UI, and a buff system. There was an
overhaul done to the staff item that gives it new primary and secondary attacks.
There has also been work done on the axe and bow. The cloud system was
overhauled and brought a cheaper way to compute the 3D noise that the system uses.
The skill bar was overhauled to implement a new design that could handle the new
buff system. This was also the first overhaul in over a year. A SFX system is in
the works to allow effects to be mapped to blocks, for sounds like crickets or
birds.</p>

is a skill-based multiplayer game where frogs fight and race using their sticky
tongues as grappling hooks.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://cratebeforeattack.com/play">browser build</a> can be played online.</p>
<p>Changes since the last update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a global leaderboard that visualizes Race and Training results in an
interactive histogram.</li>
<li>Tweaked frogs physics to make them more bouncy, added an option that would
keep tongue connected as long as a key is being pressed.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/j87I8akUTkc">Online Ghosts</a> were added. One can now compete with real
players instead of AI when playing Race mode.</li>
<li>Improved load-times: level graphics is now quantized with an 8-bit palette,
signed distance fields that are used for collisions are now generated offline.
Downloads are cached in an IndexedDB, so subsequent starts are even faster.</li>
<li>Multiple bugs were fixed.</li>

<em>One of the many unique and confounding puzzles in the game</em></p>
<p>Worship The Sun is a dark, mysterious 2D puzzle-platform game with computer
science themes. It introduces the player to a rich language of puzzle elements
and challenges them to solve difficult puzzles that require experimentation,
comprehension, and internalisation of the game's mechanics.</p>
<p>The game is built using a custom engine that sits on top of <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/legion">legion</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a>, and a handful of other crates. It features dynamic lighting, a
flexible particle system, bespoke collision behaviour, and a Vim-inspired level
editor. The majority of game assets are hand drawn in <a href="https://procreate.art/">Procreate</a>
and painstakingly animated.</p>
<p>The game is a few months into development with a release target of late 2021.
You can read about how swimming was added to the game in <a href="https://tuzz.tech/blog/taking-the-plunge">GameDev Note 1:
Taking the Plunge</a> which contains a sneak peek at some of the levels.

<em>A couple of trees growing and basking in the sun</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cyberplant.xyz">Garden</a> is a procedural tree-growing, strategical ecosystem-restoration
and biological simulation game with an infinite amount of plant species where
every leaf is simulated, and the natural resources are scarce.
Every specimen is unique, as the plants grow by responding to the live changes in
the environment.
The player has to balance many complex mechanics to sustain life and go
forward in the game.
The game and the custom engine are developed in Rust with an OpenGL backend.</p>
<p>Garden developers (temporary name) are preparing for a demo release in a couple
of months by tying everything together into a coherent experience.
The game is also continually optimized to run on less powerful GPUs,
so that everyone can enjoy it.</p>
<p>Some of the <a href="https://cyberplant.xyz/posts/october_2020">updates from the October devlog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Near-infinite variety of plant species
achieved through treating branch segments as Markov chains
(enabling different growth speeds and probabilities
for other segment types' growth from one another)
and simulating photosynthesis as an electrical circuit
(enabling sugar storage in the form of root vegetables, for example).</li>
<li>Concrete brick destruction mechanics were implemented.
Dust particles for the animation that appears upon breaking,
as well as the debris, were also added to the game.</li>
<li>Saving and loading are almost complete.</li>
<li>A watering can was added.</li>
<li>Smoother soil and debris outlines.</li>

<p><a href="https://kakoeimon.itch.io/power-kick">Power Kick</a> is a one screen platform game inspired by similar old arcade games
like Bubble Bobble and SnowBros.
Your task is to hit the enemies till they get dizzy and then kick them out of
their misery to proceed to the next stage. The kicked enemies will hit the
colliding enemies with a possibility to create a chain reaction
(similar to the pushed snowball in SnowBros).</p>
<p>The game has 20 stages and in stage 10 and 20 you will face a helicopter boss.</p>
<p>Can be played solo on the web through WebAssembly or up to two players
in the downloadable version:
the first player with the keyboard and the second one with a joypad.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs">glam</a> is a simple and fast linear algebra crate for games and graphics.</p>
<p>This month v0.10.0 was released.
There were a lot of additions in this update and a small breaking change.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The return type of <code>Vec4::truncate()</code> was changed from <code>Vec3A</code> to <code>Vec3</code> which
is a breaking change and thus the version jumped from 0.9 to 0.10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vector swizzle functions similar to those found in <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Data_Type_(GLSL)#Swizzling">GLSL</a> were added. Swizzle
functions allow a vector's elements to be reordered. The result can be a vector
of a different size to the input. Swizzles are implemented with SIMD
instructions where possible, e.g. for the <code>Vec4</code> type.</p>

<ul>
<li>density-mesh-core - generates mesh from density map.</li>
<li>density-mesh-image - generates density map from image.</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical use case would be to use two of them to create mesh from images
but in case you have your own image handler, you can stick to the core module
and produce density maps by yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bonsairobo/building-blocks">Building Blocks</a> by <a href="https://github.com/bonsairobo">@bonsairobo</a>
is an engine-agnostic voxel library that implements real-time data structures
and algorithms for: edits on compressed maps, meshing, search, and collisions.</p>
<p>The library has recently seen two releases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bonsairobo/building-blocks/releases/tag/v0.1.0">v0.1.0 release notes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bonsairobo/building-blocks/releases/tag/v0.2.0">v0.2.0 release notes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To prove out the functionality of the library, the <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/voxel-mapper">voxel-mapper</a>
project was ported to use building-blocks instead of ilattice3.
This resulted in improved performance and memory usage
when doing large edits and working with large maps:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu">Rust GPU</a> is a project backed by <a href="https://www.embark-studios.com/">Embark Studios</a>
to make Rust a first-class language and ecosystem for building GPU code.</p>
<p>Although still in very early stages of development,
<a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu/releases/tag/v0.1">Rust GPU released v0.1 in October</a>,
and has already garnered over 2000 stars on Github.
Currently, compiling and running very simple shaders
works, and a significant portion of the core library also compiles. While things
like if-statements and while-loops are working, many things aren't implemented yet.
For example, for-loops, iterators and match/switch aren't supported yet. That
means that while being technically usable, Rust GPU is far from being
production-ready.</p>
<p>The motivation behind the project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Historically in games, GPU programming has been done through writing either
HLSL, or to a lesser extent GLSL. These are simple programming languages that
have evolved along with rendering APIs over the years. However, as game engines
have evolved, these languages have failed to provide mechanisms for dealing with
large codebases, and have generally stayed behind the curve compared to other
programming languages.</p>
<p>In part this is because it's a niche language for a niche market, and in part
this has been because the industry as a whole has sunk quite a lot of time and
effort into the status quo. While over-all better alternatives to both languages
exist, none of them are in a place to replace HLSL or GLSL. Either because they
are vendor locked, or because they don't support the traditional graphics
pipeline. Examples of this include CUDA and OpenCL. And while attempts have been
made to create language in this space, none of them have gained any notable
traction in the gamedev community.</p>

<p>The <code>ggez</code> game library traditionally tries to make at least one release
at the end of each year, and that is fast approaching.  While the
graphics engine rewrite is still a work in progress, there's plenty of
other useful updates to be made.  Bugfixes, dependency updates, and other
ergonomic fixes are all on the table.  A lot of work has already been
done: removing <code>nalgebra</code> from the public API in favor of just using
<code>mint</code>, re-working some dependencies to improve build times, and
updating and cleaning up a pile of minor issues.  However, there's still
about a hundred accumulated bugs and PR's to triage and figure out, and
a lot of testing to do.  Please help!  The release checklist is
available <a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez/milestone/6">here</a>.</p>
