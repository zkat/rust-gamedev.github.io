<p>Welcome to the 35th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
<a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

Hydrofoil Generation is based on a custom-made DirectX 11 based engine in
Rust.</p>
<p>June saw a lot of features added to the game, most notables being &quot;New TV
Overlays&quot;, &quot;Control Assists&quot;, &quot;Ropes Rendering&quot; plus several physics
improvements. Stefano Casillo, the developer went through all of them in
a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/AqwqyL9RqAk">devlog</a>.</p>
<p>Work in July will focus on the physics implementation of a new boat, a

getting closer to completion. There is a large write-up about it in one of <a href="https://veloren.net/devblog-176">this
month's blog posts</a>.</p>
<p>Lots of work has also gone into optimizing the Site2 system. Site2 is used to
create many different shapes around the world, such as houses in towns, or
citadels around the world. With these optimizations, it will be significantly
easier to render chunks, which will have a dramatic effect on their load time.
You can read more about these optimizations in <a href="https://veloren.net/devblog-178">this blog post</a>.</p>

API based on the LÖVE game framework.</p>
<p>This version has finally moved ggez away from pre-ll gfx and into the world
of <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a>! This hopefully means fewer bugs, greater stability, and easier
maintainability at the cost of some low-performance devices such as the
Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>As for the user-facing API:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of module functions, you now have methods on sub-contexts, which
look like <code>ctx.keyboard.is_key_pressed(key)</code>.</li>
<li>You are now required to pass around an explicit canvas to draw onto.</li>
<li><code>DrawParam</code> now has a Z (aka layer) parameter, so you don't have to draw
objects in order.</li>
<li>Shaders are far easier to use, via normal Rust structs with a simple derive.</li>
</ul>
<p>As this is a rather large update and a first release candidate, there are plenty
of bugs that are currently being fixed - please send any issues you encounter
to their <a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez/issues">issue tracker</a>!</p>

creation platform.
Users can hop in sessions and build a game together, allowing everyone
to bring out their inner game-maker.</p>
<p>June brought about several developments for the platform, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several development and testing streams, with the latest being
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piEAGSFx-QU">a recreation of Rhodes from Red Dead Redemption 2</a> within
the engine</li>
<li>A new audio engine with advanced real-time synthesis and composition
capabilities, including network synchronisation</li>
<li>Improved terrain manipulation tools, including new brushes, biome presets,
and more intuitive UI
<ul>
<li>Choose between &quot;Nordic Mountains&quot; ⛰ and &quot;Colorado Deserts&quot; 🏜</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Various improvements to the rendering engine, including decal and billboard
rendering, FBX loading, macOS support, and more</li>
<li>Initial work on a versatile new scripting system, with independent threads of
execution for every object</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/miniquad/">miniquad</a> is a safe and cross-platform rendering library
focused on portability and low-end platform support.</p>
<p>In versions prior to 0.3, it was virtually impossible to integrate, for
example, a big in-app payments or advertisement SDK into a Miniquad Android
game. 0.3 has solved this, giving the possibility to interop with any Java code.
The developer has posted <a href="https://macroquad.rs/articles/java/">a write-up of this functionality</a> on
the macroquad site.</p>

<p>&quot;Learn Bevy's ECS by ripping off someone else's project&quot; is a mini-book that uses
the game Rusty Roguelike from the book <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust">Hands-on Rust</a>
as a base, in order to explain Bevy's ECS.</p>
<p>The idea is for a beginner to learn ECS concepts from the base book, then apply
them using Bevy; the structure of the game is ideal for a gentle introduction to
ECS architecture.</p>

<li>Ahead of the curve: A long-awaited refactor replaces the underlying
Bézier curve data structure in alignment with requirements for Pen tool
improvements and the upcoming node system.</li>
<li>Sending mixed messages: The internal messaging system was upgraded to
sequence the message processing in a more predictable stack-based order. A new

from the JS frontend to a permanent home in the Rust backend.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Ralith/psf2">psf2</a> is a minimal, unopinionated, no-std parser for the v2
<a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/%7Eaeb/linux/kbd/font-formats-1.html">PC Screen Font</a> bitmap font format.</p>
<p>PSF2 fonts are simple, compact, and readily available due to their use as Linux
console fonts. They are extremely fast to draw at their intended resolution,
making them a great choice to quickly get text on the screen, especially when a
low-resolution, fixed-width aesthetic is desired.</p>
<p>The psf2 crate parses font data, exposing font size, glyph lookup, and iterators
to traverse a glyph's bitmap for easy rendering. Due to its limited scope, it is
much smaller and faster than conventional text rasterizers but cannot support
variable-width, anti-aliased, or shaped text.</p>

targeting complete support for axis and button handling in the Bevy game
engine.</p>
<p>EZInput strives to be simple as possible using the nifty ECS features that Bevy
offers, while still being powerful and flexible without using any unsafe code.
This and the previous 0.3.* releases were targeted for performance and
ergonomics improvements, including a new declarative macro to allow for
cleaner and smaller code.</p>

</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs">glam</a> is a simple and fast linear algebra crate for games and graphics.</p>
<p>This month version 0.21 of glam was released. Because glam is not a generic
library, when support was added for <code>f64</code>, <code>i32</code>, and <code>u32</code> types back in glam
0.12, macros were used internally to avoid a lot of code duplication. This
unfortunately obfuscated the internals of glam for anyone who needed to view the
source.</p>
<p>As of the 0.21 release the majority of glam code is now generated using an
offline tool and committed to the repo. The macros that were used to define
glam's internal implementation are gone. This means what users see when reading
docs or stepping through glam in the debugger is plain old Rust code. Many
functions have also been made <code>const fn</code> removing the need for macros to create
<code>const</code> values.</p>

renderer.</p>
<p>In June, a long-standing branch landed, bringing with it a complete
overhaul of indirect lighting. The new implementation uses spatiotemporal
reservoir resampling (ReSTIR) and a novel irradiance cache, bringing forth
larger scenes, quicker response to lighting changes, and less noise.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/kajiya/blob/main/docs/gi-overview.md">detailed overview</a> of the new global illumination
techniques is available, complete with animated diagrams!</p>
<p>June has also seen the addition of texture compression, automatic exposure,
a new display rendering transform, and a simplification of the interface.
The viewer app now supports drag-and-drop of scene files, glTF models,
and HDRI backdrops.</p>
