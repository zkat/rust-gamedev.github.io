<p>A 4K intro is a demo where the entire program (including any data)
has to be 4096 bytes or less so it is important
that the code is as space efficient as possible.
Rust has a bit of a reputation for creating bloated executables so I wanted
to find out if is possible to create very space efficient code with it.</p>

sales by platform/country/OS, player feedback &amp; reviews, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People mostly don’t publish sales figures,
I guess it makes more business sense to be vague.
But maybe these will be helpful or interesting in some way.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/VladZhukov0">Vlad Zhukov</a> shared a video of a WIP multiplayer online strategy game
where you fight with other players for territory.
Currently, there are two types of resources and 5 types of buildings.
To build on the tile you need to occupy it with your warriors first.
The player who occupied all enemies' tiles win.</p>
<p>The game is written with <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/miniquad">miniquad</a>
and a custom GUI library.
Some parts of the game are promised to be open-sourced in the future.

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/pglowrpg">@pGLOWrpg</a> (Procedurally Generated Living Open World RPG) is a long-term
project in development by <a href="https://twitter.com/Roal_Yr">@Roal_Yr</a>, which aims to be a text-based game with
maximum portability and accessibility and focus on interactions and emergent
narrative.</p>
<p>For the past month(s) the main focus of the development was on the river
generation system in the worldgen. Main features of the river generator are:</p>
<ul>
<li>High robustness with most edge cases covered;</li>
<li>Single-pass with subsequent iterations generation, with numerous options to
tweak the process for either precision of the pattern or speed of generation;</li>
<li>Rivers are sorted upon intersections, their widths are adjusted, waterfalls
are formed when necessary;</li>
<li>Inflow and outflow directions are recorded for each cell, which allows
following the river upstream or downstream;</li>
<li>Simple yet effective erosion model implemented, which ensures no upwards flows
are allowed;</li>
<li>Each stream has its unique ID, which will later be linked to the stream data;</li>
<li>Streams have 12 orders of magnitude from smallest brooks to major rivers;</li>
<li>All the options are available to user under &quot;General&quot;, &quot;Advanced&quot; and
&quot;Very advanced&quot; sections for any level of fine-tuning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further development will involve re-factoring of the code and making it ready
to be published prior to implementing new features. For small dev reports follow

particle types to place, and then you get to watch the resulting interactions!</p>
<p>As they didn't make it in time for last month's newsletter, this month's edition
covers the work they did in June and July:</p>
<ul>
<li>Released version 1.0 and 1.1, created a flatpak package and associated metadata,
and published it to <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.jms55.Sandbox">Flathub</a>.</li>
<li>Several new particles such as Fire, Mirror, Glitch, and some hidden ones,
and tweaked or overhalled almost every other particle!</li>
<li>A fancy new glow post process effect for Acid/Fire/Electricity,
created using wgpu-rs compute shaders.
<ul>
<li>As a precursor to this, they made a PR to the pixels crate that removes the
old RenderPass approach in favor of giving the user direct access to wgpu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Made a slick new icon and background for the game.</li>
<li>Added a video recording feature using gstreamer-rs and x264enc,
and then later removed it (for now).
<ul>
<li>Moving from recording the raw texture generated for pixels
to the post-processed texture from wgpu
involved a major overhaul, and it proved too glitchy and slow.
Hopefully, it will be revived later, in the form of recording user inputs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many structural improvements, such as less glitchy particle
placement with Bresenham's line algorithm,
better error handling, and ensuring particles
are only ever stored on the heap.</li>
<li>Performance improvements, including generating noise in a separate thread.</li>
<li>Currently WIP: UI using imgui.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/amethyst/shotcaller">shotcaller</a> is a WIP quick (~7mins) ASCII-rendered RTS/MOBA game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the way &quot;MOBA&quot; games such as DOTA2 or LoL are usually played,
the captain of the team is the default shotcaller.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shotcaller needs to be unbiased and not have tunnel vision.
You need to be able to think in the future and tell
what would happen if you did this or that.
This becomes crucial when deciding to base-race or teleport back to defend.

<p>Everyone on the team can play the part of Shotcaller on occasion.
The act of shotcalling is not typically the most prevalent activity of any player,
even for a captain — after all, they also need to play their hero.</p>
<p>But in this game, all you do is shotcalling and big-picture strategizing.
The game plays as if you were controlling the 6th-person-in-the-booth “coach” player,
and your team (of AI-played bots) actually follows
your instructions to the letter, within their designed constraints.</p>

post-process in less than <a href="https://github.com/ApoorvaJ/graphene/blob/a1ee574d92445f4cff195ca517af2912ebfce697/src/demos/00/main.rs">250 lines of Rust code</a>.
Current features include easy Vulkan initialization, automatic swapchain
resizing, glTF mesh loading, and shader hot-reloading.

<em>Click to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks_HQbejHE4">the video demo</a> running on iOS.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/aclysma">@aclysma</a> published a <a href="https://github.com/aclysma/renderer_prototype">new vulkan-based renderer</a> that
uses <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/atelier-assets">atelier-assets</a> to load 3D scenes exported from blender.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The objective of this repo is to build a scalable, flexible, data driven
renderer. Scalable in the sense of performance as well as suitability for
use in large, real-world projects. This means streaming, LODs, visibility
systems, and multi-threaded draw call submission need to be possible.
Additionally it means thinking through how an asset pipeline would work for
a team with dedicated artists and supporting workflow-friendly features
like hot reloading assets, possibly on remote devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This video demonstrates the renderer running on iOS and receiving asset updates
via wifi. The scene is &quot;sponza&quot; exported from blender. Vulkan is supported on
windows and linux natively. Support for macOS and iOS is via the
well-established <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK">MoltenVK</a> project.</p>
<p>The demo was ported from PC to iOS over a single weekend and out of
approximately 300 crate dependencies (including complex, OS-specific ones like
tokio), all but a few worked out-of-the-box!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi">Ludusavi</a> is a tool written in Rust by <a href="https://twitter.com/mtkennerly">@mtkennerly</a> for backing up PC game
save data. It has backup info for more than 7,000 games, is cross-platform for
Windows, Linux, and Mac, and has a GUI as well as a command line interface.
The GUI was created using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/iced">Iced</a> crate.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-manifest">backup info</a> is sourced from <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home">PCGamingWiki</a> so that everyone can help to
expand the data, and it's stored in a documented format so that other backup
tools can share the same data set. A <a href="https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi-playnite">plugin</a> for <a href="https://playnite.link">Playnite</a> was also just
released.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SuperTails/langcraft">Langcraft</a> is the Minecraft LLVM target you've never wanted.</p>
<p>Langcraft started as a dare to the <code>#lang-dev</code> channel of the Rust
Community Discord to be able to parse Rust code in Minecraft.
Naturally, it grew into a full code generator that can translate
most LLVM IR to
<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_Pack">Minecraft data packs</a>,
the game's deliberately-limited in-game scripting language. Langcraft
is entirely language independent, so any language with an LLVM-based
compiler can (with the right API bindings) run in Minecraft. Currently,
bindings to both C and Rust exist. While not as visually impressive as
a redstone computer, Langcraft does stretch the bounds of the game quite
a bit, using jukeboxes for memory, armor stands to represent pointers,
and rearranging compiled code to make it run in the bounds of the data
packs' fixed instruction limit.</p>
<p>This is all, naturally, entirely useless. The project is also still
heavily work-in-progress and does not pretend to be stable, but it is
usable. A handwritten interpreter for a Rust-like language has already
been demonstrated running, and even more complex projects like <a href="https://github.com/Dhole/chip8-rs.git">CHIP-8
emulators</a> function (albeit at
extremely slow speed).</p>
<p>You can watch a <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Cx0w5Wn9pPU">video of Rust interpreter running Fizzbuzz</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://fedorgames.itch.io/shar">SHAR</a> (Russian &quot;Шар&quot; - ball) by <a href="https://twitter.com/fedor_games">@fedor_games</a> (author of <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/miniquad">miniquad</a>/<a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad">macroquad</a>)
is a 3rd-person online action game that aims to create unique experience
combining destructible world and team-based ball game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SHAR is an action combination of tactical and sports game in the destructible world.
The rules are extremely simple: two teams, one ball.
The team that carries the ball into the opponent's gates gets a score,
the team with the most score at the end of the game is the winner.
However, this is where things get interesting!
Players have the variety of skills and tricks and destructible environment
to fiddle around to slam the opponent and win the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the game's features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A network-synchronized physics engine powered by bullet-rs;</li>
<li>A bunch of physics-based player skills;</li>
<li>Extensive build-in editors for game maps, skeletal animation,
effects &amp; particle systems;</li>
<li>Modding support.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game was built on top of a homegrown game engine using:
winit, glium, imgui-rs, <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/tinyecs">tinyecs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/not-fl3/awesomium-rs">awesomium-rs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nickbrowne/ears">ears</a>.</p>

<p>During RustFest Zurich 2017, Fedor gave a self-descriptive talk
&quot;SHAR: Rust's gamedev experience&quot;.
You can <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=nXR8f4r6ggM">watch the recording here</a>.</p>
<p>The game was in active development around 2016-2017.
In 2017 the game <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=868228143">passed Steam Greenlight</a>.
During 2018 <a href="https://fedorgames.itch.io/shar/devlog/52720/time-to-move-on">the project was suspended</a>.</p>
