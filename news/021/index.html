<p>The fourth Rust Gamedev Meetup happened in April. It was an opportunity for
developers to show off what Rust projects they've been working on in the game
ecosystem. This month, we heard a talk about threading in WASM, profiling,
getting a game ready for release, and much more. You can watch the recording of
the meetup <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE0lH0tlbBs">here on Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>The meetups take place on the second Saturday every month via the <a href="https://discord.gg/yNtPTb2">Rust
Gamedev Discord server</a>, and can also be <a href="https://twitch.tv/rustgamedev">streamed on
Twitch</a>. If you would like to show off what you've been

<ul>
<li>Automate complex processes by combining machines and programmable workers.</li>
<li>Obtain materials from a wide variety of natural resources: Even chicken!</li>
<li>An upbeat, wholesome aesthetic: Factories don't need to be depressing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last month was focused on implementing the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayTheProcess/status/1381648397569036291">test map</a> to
ensure all corners of the codebase are working</li>
<li>Improved player mobility by introducing a

its first initial playable alpha version. Stayed tuned to the official twitter

is a Tower Defense game that's controlled solely by typing words and phrases.</p>
<p>Taipo is intended to be a thin veneer of a game over a tool for practicing
Japanese, but there's an English mode as well. Gameplay sessions are short and
the game is playable in a desktop web browser.</p>
<p>Taipo was built with <a href="https://bevyengine.org">Bevy 0.5</a> with web builds made possible by

support for any city with OpenStreetMap coverage.</p>
<p>In April, a new road editor was prototyped, letting the number and width of
lanes be changed. Initial installation and downloading new maps is now simpler.
Slowly, complex intersections are being handled better. The team also completed
four usability study sessions and adjusted the UI accordingly.</p>

Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In April, work started on 0.10. Work is being done on combat, with new models
being created for enemies, animations being refined, and new player gear being
added. The trading and economic systems have continued progress at a good pace.
The music system was expanded to support combat music.</p>
<p>Veloren's financial state was overhauled to examine previous expenses, and
prepare for provisioning the dedicated server. Functionality was added to switch
between server-authoritative and client-authoritative physics. Skeletons for
big-winged creatures were added. Data being sent over the network is being
optimized to reduce the amount of bandwidth players have to use.</p>

<p>They are now working on the <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/theta-wave/projects/4">&quot;Loot&quot;</a> update which will enhance how loot drops
are rolled, spawned, and how their effects are applied to the game.</p>

<em>A demo Arcana game</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/arcana">Arcana</a> is a new game engine built with focus on ease of use
without compromising on level of control.
The engine is aimed to support a wide variety of games,
from pixel-art to fully ray-traced,
from single-player puzzles to online strategies.</p>
<p>It is at a very early stage, not all necessary subsystems are done
and code is in flux.</p>
<p>The demo shown above was coded in a single evening,
together with sprite sheet loading and sprite animations
which will be integrated into the engine later.</p>
<p>The default 2D renderer renders sprites with auto-batching,
so all sprites are rendered in single instanced draw call,
allowing rendering millions of sprites in one frame. Rendering
is done with <a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/sierra"><code>sierra</code></a> - a Vulkan-like graphics API with
batteries included. The engine also uses <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hecs"><code>hecs</code></a> as its ECS,
and rolls its own simplistic <code>System</code> trait to define and run
systems, once per frame or with fixed steps. <a href="https://rapier.rs/docs/"><code>rapier</code></a> physics
is integrated for 2D cases, but this system is kept opt-in.</p>

<em>Rafx WebGL 1.0 support, <a href="https://aclysma.github.io/rafx/demo-web/index.html">click for live demo</a>!</em></p>
<p>Rafx is a multi-backend renderer that optionally integrates with the
<a href="https://github.com/amethyst/distill">distill</a> asset pipeline. This month, frustum culling
and a new OpenGL ES 2.0/WebGL 1.0 backend were added.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DavidVonDerau">@dvd</a> revived the <code>rafx-visibility</code> crate and implemented frustum culling.
Frustum culling greatly reduces draw call counts, improving frame rate
in certain scenes. The changes also improve consistency between various
rendering feature implementations (i.e. meshes, text etc.) and avoids running
the extract-prepare-submit pipeline on entities that are not visible.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aclysma">@aclysma</a> implemented an OpenGL ES 2.0 backend. While ES2 cannot support all
functionality in <code>rafx-api</code>, it provides very broad compatibility. This means
the core functionality of rafx-api can be used with almost any mobile device
or browser (<a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=webgl">~98% web coverage</a>.)</p>

<em>RAUI Scroll Box</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PsichiX/raui">RAUI</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/psichix">@PsichiX</a> is a Renderer Agnostic User
Interface crate that is based on declarative mode UI composition similar to
React.js and UE4 Slate system.</p>
<p>This month's changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moved from <code>widget_hooks!</code> and <code>widget_component!</code> to <code>#[pre_hooks]</code>and
<code>#[post_hooks]</code> macros.</li>
<li>Added <code>PropsData</code> and <code>MessageData</code> derive macros.</li>
<li>Improved support for Scroll Box widgets to allow frictionless usage.</li>
<li>Added use of Scroll Box in <a href="https://github.com/PsichiX/raui/tree/master/demos/todo-app">TODO demo app</a> to demonstrate how
to use it.</li>

<a href="https://twitter.com/GraphiteEditor">Twitter</a>) is an in-progress vector and
raster graphics editor built on a nondestructive node-based workflow.</p>
<p>The team size has doubled in the past month — thank you to the new contributors!
Since then, systems related to editor tools and data flow were added.
The editor now has proper input behavior on the existing Rectangle and Ellipse Tools
plus the new Shape and Line Tools while holding modifier keys.
Pen Tool implementation has begun, supporting polylines.
Shapes are now drawn with live previews.</p>
<p>Additional work has gone into improving render performance, building the color
system in the Rust backend, and adding initial support for displaying shapes
in the Layer Tree panel. <a href="https://editor.graphite.design/">Try it right now in your browser.</a></p>
<p>Graphite is making rapid progress towards becoming a nondestructive, procedural
graphics editor suitable of replacing traditional 2D DCC applications. Please

code and how you can help!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/henryksloan/kind-nes/releases/tag/v0.9.1-beta">KindNES</a> by <a href="https://github.com/henryksloan">@henryksloan</a>
is a new NES emulator that supports sound, controllers, and
much of the NES library.</p>
<p>KindNES is designed to strike a balance between performance, hardware accuracy,
and code clarity. It directly emulates the CPU, graphics, and sound of the NES
with minimal approximation. The code is intended to pair well with the NESdev
wiki as a resource for learning about the NES.</p>
<p>KindNES is in a playable state, and is approaching a release version.
Features planned before release include saving and an improved cross-platform
GUI.</p>

<em>Debugging Pong</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JonathanMurray/chip-8-rs">Chip-8-rs</a> by @jonathanmurray is
a CHIP-8 emulator with some basic debugging functionality.</p>
<p>When running a game through the emulator, CHIP-8 instructions are listed
next to the main display, with the currently executed one highlighted. By
running at a very low clock-frequency (and pausing/resuming) you can step
through a program one instruction at a time, to better understand how it
works (or doesn't work!).</p>
