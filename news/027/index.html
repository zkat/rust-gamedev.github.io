Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In October, Veloren hit 10,000 commits, as well as 10,000 members on the Discord
server! Shrubs got added, along with improvements to rivers, and the
addition of waterfalls. There have been efforts to diagnose some network issues
that have been causing downloads to not work for some people. Crafting is going
through overhauls on the backend. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60kt915avjI">New aurora shaders</a>
were added as well.</p>
<p>Initial ideas are being discussed to try and improve the
amount of asset files that have to be downloaded with each update of the game,
which will help improve the 200MB that has to be downloaded after each nightly
update. New jewelery has been added, and sneaking is being improved to make
agents in the game react better to it. Ongoing worldgen improvemnts are also
being made as we head into November.</p>

is a game/engine for worlds made of blocks made of voxels. It is intended to be
usable both as an engine or rendering library, or as a game with built-in
editor/programming functionality (genre(s) to be determined). While the project
is still highly incomplete and API-unstable, the 0.3.0 release marks a lot of
now-usable functionality (<a href="https://github.com/kpreid/all-is-cubes/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#030-2021-10-09">changelog</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>UI: mouselook, multiple example scenes, inventory with stacks, and rendering
to image files.</li>
<li>Simulation/mechanics: character collision against arbitrary voxel shapes,
much-improved light propagation, transactional state updates (all-or-nothing,
internally order-independent), and “behaviors” attached to game objects for
scripting/animation.</li>
<li>Rendering: high-voxel-count blocks (incomplete, but usable for text as seen in
the above screenshot), “smooth lighting” (interpolated across faces), frustum
culling, and correct sRGB-versus-linear color handling.</li>

<em>experimental Bevy branch running on WebGL2 via wgpu</em></p>
<p>The team is happy to announce the release of wgpu-0.11 and naga-0.7.
Details can be found on the <a href="https://gfx-rs.github.io/2021/10/07/release-0.11.html">gfx-rs blog</a>. The most exciting feature
is WebGL2 support. With some caveats, users no longer need to wait for
WebGPU in the browsers in order to deploy on the Web. Support is still
a bit rough, and patches come out regularly, but most examples work.</p>
<p>@kvark also visited <a href="https://rustlang.la/">Rust LA Meetup</a> to <a href="https://vimeo.com/632377558">talk about Naga</a>

<p><img src="rend3-scifi.jpg" alt="rend3-scifi" />
<em>Improved shadows and rendering with rend3 0.2</em></p>
<p>rend3 is a 3D rendering library that focuses on having an easy to use interface
without sacrificing performance or customizability.</p>
<p>As part of their monthly release schedule, the developers are excited to
announce the release of rend3-0.2. The most prominent change is the ability
to use fully customizable materials. Any combination of data and textures can
now be used as a material for custom render routines. This unties the user
from PBR-based materials.</p>
<p>Along with the customizability that comes with this change, the CPU time
required to render a complex scene is 7x less due to highly optimal data
structures. For more information see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0wGz5UJTrY">this talk</a> at the Rust
graphics meetup.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rend3">v0.2 version</a> was published on crates.io
(<a href="https://docs.rs/rend3">docs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BVE-Reborn/rend3/tree/v0.2/examples">examples</a>). The 0.3 release is
just a week away and further improves customizability.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/smokku/hecs_rapier">hecs_rapier</a> is a physics engine for hecs ECS.
It is a direct port of <a href="https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier">bevy_rapier2d</a>.</p>
<p>Recent development added joints and physics_hooks support.
This makes <code>hecs_rapier</code> feature complete, with <code>bevy_rapier2d</code> feature parity.</p>

is a procedural sky plugin for Bevy.</p>
<p>By adding the <code>AtmospherePlugin</code>, users get a skybox around the camera in their scene.
Users can also set the appearance of the sky adding a <code>AtmosphereMat</code> resource.</p>
<p>0.1.0 and 0.1.1 have been released on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy_atmosphere">crates.io</a>.</p>
<p>0.1.1 changes the default position of the sun to be in the sky,
so only the plugin is needed to get a Unity-like sky.</p>

<p>In the latest version <code>0.6.0</code>, you can load files with custom semantic
durations and play looped audio with an intro. The plugin now also cleans up
old sound instances. Following Bevy, <a href="https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_kira_audio">bevy_kira_audio</a> is now licensed under
dual MIT + Apache 2.0, and the library will no longer crash on systems without

providing a plugin to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration">verlet integration</a>
physics. Very useful for cloth simulation and joints, and less expensive than
complex physics engine, it is a nice addition to 2D or 3D projects. Making good
use of the Entity-Component-System architecture of the bevy engine, any entity
can become a <code>VerletPoint</code> and have physics applied to it.</p>
<p>The crate also provides <em>sticks</em> which constrains the points in order to create
strings or cloth. With its modularity, you may customize the physics precision
(iterations), the gravity, and the physics time step to use.</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query parallel batching and custom batching size</li>
<li>Global documentation</li>
<li>Fixed issues with timesteps</li>

<p><img src="bevy_pen_tool2.gif" alt="bevy_pen_tool2" /></p>
<p>Bevy Pen Tool is a plugin that helps developers make 2D paths using
Bezier curves. Its user interface provides functionality for:</p>
<ul>
<li>spawning Bezier curves,</li>
<li>moving end points and control points of Bezier curves,</li>
<li>linking individual Bezier curves to each other,</li>
<li>grouping curves,</li>
<li>saving and loading paths as look-up tables
(typically for animations and agent movement),</li>
<li>generating arbitrary 2D meshes that fill the interior of a path
using the Lyon crate,</li>
<li>generating a mesh that follows a path like a road,</li>
<li>saving meshes and roads in &quot;.obj&quot; format,</li>
</ul>
<p>A stable version of Bevy Pen Tool should come out as a crate shortly
after Bevy 0.6 shows up. Here is a link to the <a href="https://github.com/eliotbo/bevy_pen_tool">repo for more
information</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/LechintanTudor/sparsey">Sparsey</a> by <a href="https://github.com/LechintanTudor">@LechintanTudor</a> is a sparse set-based Entity Component System
(ECS) with component storage grouping, granular component change detection,
fallible systems and beautiful syntax.</p>
<p>The latest release (0.4) adds support for optional system parameters, which
allows <code>Option&lt;Res&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>Option&lt;ResMut&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> to be used in system functions.</p>
<p>This release also features a refactored <code>ComponentStorage</code> which makes adding,
removing and swapping components faster, swapping being especially important
since it enables component grouping, a features that makes certain queries
specified by the user extremely fast.</p>
<p>Finally, some implementation details were hidden from the public API and the
<code>#[must_use]</code> attribute was added to functions whose results should not be
discarded.</p>

is a Rust library that provides bindings for the Godot game engine.</p>
<p>Recent developments have added <a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/pull/804">foundational support to async</a>
that enables users to make use of the Rust async runtimes with the Godot Engine
(thanks to chitoyuu for the PR).</p>
<p>In addition to the foundational support, lyonbeckers was kind enough to
include a <a href="https://github.com/godot-rust/book/pull/44">new recipe in the User Guide</a> that covers
how to configure async with <code>tokio</code>.</p>
